    Microsoft ResX Schema 
    
    Version 2.0
    
    The primary goals of this format is to allow a simple XML format 
    that is mostly human readable. The generation and parsing of the 
    various data types are done through the TypeConverter classes 
    associated with the data types.
    
    Example:
    
    ... ado.net/XML headers & schema ...
    <resheader name="resmimetype">text/microsoft-resx</resheader>
    <resheader name="version">2.0</resheader>
    <resheader name="reader">System.Resources.ResXResourceReader, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <resheader name="writer">System.Resources.ResXResourceWriter, System.Windows.Forms, ...</resheader>
    <data name="Name1"><value>this is my long string</value><comment>this is a comment</comment></data>
    <data name="Color1" type="System.Drawing.Color, System.Drawing">Blue</data>
    <data name="Bitmap1" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded serialized .NET Framework object]</value>
    </data>
    <data name="Icon1" type="System.Drawing.Icon, System.Drawing" mimetype="application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64">
        <value>[base64 mime encoded string representing a byte array form of the .NET Framework object]</value>
        <comment>This is a comment</comment>
    </data>
                
    There are any number of "resheader" rows that contain simple 
    name/value pairs.
    
    Each data row contains a name, and value. The row also contains a 
    type or mimetype. Type corresponds to a .NET class that support 
    text/value conversion through the TypeConverter architecture. 
    Classes that don't support this are serialized and stored with the 
    mimetype set.
    
    The mimetype is used for serialized objects, and tells the 
    ResXResourceReader how to depersist the object. This is currently not 
    extensible. For a given mimetype the value must be set accordingly:
    
    Note - application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64 is the format 
    that the ResXResourceWriter will generate, however the reader can 
    read any of the formats listed below.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.binary.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Binary.BinaryFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.
    
    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.soap.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized with 
            : System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.SoapFormatter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

    mimetype: application/x-microsoft.net.object.bytearray.base64
    value   : The object must be serialized into a byte array 
            : using a System.ComponentModel.TypeConverter
            : and then encoded with base64 encoding.

  <data name="ch1IAmDrKaden" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My name is Dr. Alexander Kaden. If you can hear me, or at least, read what I'm saying, then you've come at a good time. This evening, I'm going to drink an elixir that allows me to possess other people.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1ThisIsNewFerando" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>That's the city of New Ferando out there. It's the main port of the western continent. I have lived on this continent since I was young. The people here will be the first to see my making of history. This rainy evening, everything changes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1IDrinkElixir" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is no point in wasting time. I drink the elixir. As I do, I smell the mixture of blood. It was a special kind of blood, and an essential ingredient. It reminds me of how much work it took to make this. I finish the elixir, but there's some time left before it'll take effect.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1ILeaveHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I leave my hotel room and walk out to the city below. There are plenty of people walking by the streets, but it's not that loud. I'm a bit excited, and I don't feel that a lot nowadays. Once this elixir takes effect, there are a lot of things I can do, and these people around me have no idea what's about to happen.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1IGoToAlley" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It's been some time now, and I don't feel well. My mind is spacing out, and I might be getting weaker. I turn into a nearby alley and fall to my knees.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1OfficerSeesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A patrolling police officer notices me and stops in the alley. "Are you all right, Sir?" he asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1MyFaceDisappears" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm still lightheaded, but I manage to tilt my head up to look at the officer. I cannot feel my own face though. Is it missing?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1IOpenMyEyes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just a moment later, I can open my eyes. This has to be it. I'm as light as vapor now. This is a good opportunity to test my new ability.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1IPossessOfficer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Without hesitation, I leap towards the officer. My body is now a black, gaseous mass, and I can feel myself flying. My old pile of clothes is left behind as I absorb myself into the officer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1ILookAtMyHands" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My hands, my skin, my clothes, they're all different. The elixir must have worked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1IGoToOfficersHome" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I need to rest and think about what I'll do. I find the officer's car nearby and drive to his home. I didn't really need to think about where this officer lived. It just came naturally to me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch1ISleep" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I go up into the officer's apartment. The bedroom inside is all right. I lie on the bed and nap.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2Title" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Chapter 2</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2TimeAgo" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>8 years ago …</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ThereWereFourGods" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I was attending L'Université de Éclair in the mainland, and was in Prof. Arvin's world history lecture at the time. "Six hundred years ago, the natives of the western continent lived in peace," he said. "Those natives worshiped four gods."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ThereWasSezja" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sezja was the god of play. Behind his wooden mask was a joyful man with long, flowing hair."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ThereWasBaqer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Baqer was the god of indulgence. He was the chief of the gods, and he basked himself in his own power."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ThereWasVaNal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Va'Nal was the goddess of romance. Few could resist her beautiful, leafy, green hair."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ThereWasBekShtii" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Finally, Bek'Shtii was the god of tradition and the past. While he was not the leader, Bek'Shtii was perhaps the smartest of the group."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2LectureEnded" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I relaxed for the rest of the lecture. "That is all for today," the professor concluded. "I have my normal office hours, if anyone needs them."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2IWentToProfArvin" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After class, I walked to Prof. Arvin's office to see him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2IGreetProf" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello, Professor," I said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ProfGreetsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello, Kaden, what do you need?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2IConfideToProf" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, I've been studying for your class, but I've been having a lot on my mind. I've been thinking about other things. I'm not sure what the best thing to do is."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch2ProfDismissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Kaden, I am just a professor. I am not a counselor. I am not sure about what you can do. However, whatever the problem is, I hope that you can take care of it so that you can do well here. Take care, Kaden." The professor and I shook hands, and I left.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3Title" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Chapter 3</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IAwaken" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I wake up, feeling refreshed. I had a feeling that waking up in a different body would be awkward, but I'm actually adjusting fairly well.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3SezjaGreetsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Good morning, Sleepy Head!"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3SezjaStartlesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Waah! Who are you?" I ask the man lying next to me, on the bed. He's wearing a robe and a wooden tribal mask, the same mask that the natives of the west wore. I assume that he's Sezja, one of the native gods. I don't see how any other person could have gotten into this room, especially dressed like that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3SezjaAnswers" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"My brother said that he sensed someone drinking his blood, so I just came by to see who it was. Now that that mystery's solved, I guess I can leave you alone, for now. Oh, and I'll see if I can get the rest of the family to meet you. Ta ta!" Sezja says, and slides off the edge of the bed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3SezjaLeaves" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I lean over the edge to see him, but he's gone.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IHaveToSignOut" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, it seems like I'm almost ready to start my body-hopping adventure in earnest, but I have three more things to worry about. First, I have to sign out of my hotel room, since I don't want to pay for any more nights. I deliberately left the key in the room, so I'll fly through the crack in either the door or the window to get it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3PoliceWillBeSuspicious" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Second, the police department might be getting suspicious that I, as this police officer, haven't reported over the night.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IHaveToReturnToArcticon" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Third, I live at the Arcticon Research Facility, a large underground science complex located in the snowy mountains north on this continent. However, Arcticon's entrance is restricted to authorized personnel, and I won't be recognized as this officer, so I need another way to get in and out of there.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3MyWorkIsCutOut" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, I have my work cut out for me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3ICallCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I use the phone in the officer's apartment to call a good coworker of mine, Dr. Caitlyn Rylie. "Hello Caitlyn, I'm Dr. Kaden," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynDoesNotRecognizeMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Dr. Kaden? You sound different," says Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3ITellCaitlynIDrankElixir" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Do you remember the chemical compound that we were all working on? Well, I finally drank a sample of it, and now I can possess other people."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynBelievesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, Kadey, it really is you. So, you're in a different body then?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IAskCaitlynToCome" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, that's right, Caitlyn. Anyway, I can't get back to Arcticon the way I am now. Can you pick me and drive us back?" After giving Caitlyn my street address, she agrees. "Also, we need to stop off at the hotel that I was staying at. Is that okay, Caitlyn?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynAgreesToCome" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Uh, okay, Kaden," she says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynComes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Nearly an hour later, Caitlyn pulls in front of the apartment building. "Caitlyn, over here!" I wave.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynNoticesMeAsOfficer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, hey, you really did switch bodies. And you're a cop? Well, all right, get in."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IAskToPossessCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Actually, I need to leave this body here. I don't want the police department to trace any place past this officer's home. That means I need to possess you, Caitlyn."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynHesitatesPossession" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Me?" Caitlyn asks. "Do you have to? I mean, it just seems invasive. That's all." She scratches her head.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IJustifyPossession" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, if I'm not in a body, I can be in a gaseous form, but then we couldn't keep a low profile."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynAsksMeToDisguiseAsInfant" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn looks at a towel in the back seat. "Wait," she says. "I can wrap you in my towel, and it'll look like you're a baby in a blanket. It'd be cute! Well, how about it?" she asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IDiguiseAsInfant" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay Caitlyn, you can wrap me in the towel if you want to."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynBringsMeToHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I fly out of the officer and onto the towel. "Thanks, Kadey," Caitlyn says, as she wraps me in. She drives to the hotel and goes up to my floor.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IEnterHotelRoomFromBlanket" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn puts me down, in front of my door. I fly through the bottom of the door, get the key, give the keys to Caitlyn, and fly back into my blanket.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynChecksOut" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn and I go down to the lobby. While Caitlyn is checking out with the receptionist, the receptionist notices me. "Oh, what a cute baby. Can I see?" she asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynTriesToShowReceptionistMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn tries to turn me towards the receptionist, but I resist. Can Caitlyn not realize how showing my face could blow our cover? "What's wrong, Kadey? Why don't you want to look away from my chest? Did you want to drink?" Caitlyn asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3ReceptionistLikesKatie" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, her name's Katie? That's such a good name!" says the receptionist. I roll my eyes.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynLeavesHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, we have to go," says Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynCannotBreastFeed" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once we're back in the car, Caitlyn comes to a realization. "Wait, I can't breast-feed you anyway. You don't have a mouth. Also, I need to give birth to an actual baby to produce milk anyway. I'm a doctor, so I should have known that. Oops." Caitlyn is right. I don't have a mouth in this form, although I might still be able to talk without it. I'm about to call her out for her absent-mindedness, but I decide against it, since she is a good friend.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynDrivesOnHighway" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn drives north on the highway to Arcticon.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3CaitlynEntersArcticon" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We reach the snowy mountain pass, one of the highest points on this continent, and one that gives a great view. We pass through Arcticon's security checkpoint without incident. Caitlyn parks in the parking garage, and we take the adjoining tram, which goes to the underground research center.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3ILeaveBlanket" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Afterwards, I fly out of the baby blanket.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IRefuseToDiguiseAsInfant" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"No, Caitlyn. No one will think that I'm a baby if they actually see my face."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IWillOweCaitlynAFavor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, but you owe me if I ever need a favor later on," says Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IGoToHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Understood." I fly out of the officer and into Caitlyn. I drive to the hotel and go up to my floor.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IEnterHotelRoomFromCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I kneel in front of my door and fly out of Caitlyn, fly through the bottom of the door, get the key, and fly back into Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3ICheckOut" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I go down to the lobby and check out with the receptionist. "You don't look like a 'Mr. Kaden'," says the receptionist, skeptically.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IClaimToBeMyWife" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'm his wife. I'm just checking out for him," I reply.</value>

    <value>"How can I be sure about that?" she asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch3IInsultReceptionist" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Because I know more about his tastes than you do, Plain Jane," I smirk, tossing my key onto her desk and leaving.</value>

  <data name="ch3IDispossessCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="ch3CaitlynExplainsMyGhostliness" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="ch3BekShtiiAsksMeToStay" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Correct, but there is a problem. The park is not open to the entire public at the moment, and flying over the park as a spirit might draw the ire of the park rangers. Stay here for today, as I will return here tomorrow to share a plan with you."</value>

    <value>"It is not that. Of course developing a compound that changes its consumer's form is a significant accomplishment. Kaden, you have good ideas, and sometimes, you execute them well, and I am certain that the science community values you for that. However, I want to talk about your work ethics. For example, you lied to our supervisor about the compound that you were working on actually was. Then, you managed to convince him to have Caitlyn and I help you with it. This morning, you asked Caitlyn to drive you back here. She is not your chauffeur. She is your coworker, as am I. You are not our boss. You, Caitlyn, and I are equal in rank. It is no secret that Caitlyn has a soft spot for us two, but you seem to take it for granted."</value>

  <data name="ch4FieldTripBegan" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I was on a field trip that day. I was with my class at the Science History Museum. Our tour guide, a retired scientist, showed many different inventions and the various breakthroughs in physics, biology, chemistry, and other sciences. Later in the tour, the guide, now visibly exhausted and sweating, showed us some chemical compounds made by one of the greatest alchemists of the early modern period. These exhibits intrigued me. "I've met a good many geniuses throughout my life. Who knows, perhaps the next great innovator is with us now," said the tour guide.</value>

  <data name="ch5BekShtiiWakesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Wake up," says Bek'Shtii. I'm groggy, but I eventually come to my senses. "I have a plan for you to reach our home. In two days, students from St. Josephine's Secondary School will go on a field trip to the Western Continental Park. You need to go to that school, possess a student there, and get on that field trip."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5PlanIsRoundabout" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"That sounds like a roundabout way to get to your ancient city. Is it really so bad for me to go straight there like this?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5RangersCannotCaptureMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yes, if the park rangers see you, they might capture you on surveillance video. If you appear on video, then the modern world will have proof that spirits, even false spirits like you, still exist. If that happens, even more people will try to seize power from us. It is bad enough that you already have done so."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IEnterVent" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Bek'Shtii points to the vent on my wall. "Use the ventilation system to leave your underground complex and go south to the suburban district of New Ferando. Stay behind the tree line as you follow the highway. As a false spirit, you can run quickly without exhaustion. You have little more than an hour before sunrise. Go, now." I nod and fly through my vent.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IExitVent" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After a minute of navigating upwards through the Arcticon vent system, I reach the surface. I have my clothes reappear on me, just like last time, and run alongside the quiet, nearly-empty highway.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IReachSchool" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I eventually reach St. Josephine's Secondary School. It's not daylight just yet, but I see a building on the campus that is most likely a dormitory. I see a window that is slightly open, so I fly up through it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IPossessElodie" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I see two single beds, both of which had people sleeping in them. It was too dark to see who they were, so I take my chances and jump into one of them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CarleighWakesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I must have fallen asleep for at least an hour, since when I regain consciousness, the sun is shining brightly outside. "Ellie, Ellie! Wake up! We need to go to class," says a girl from the other bed. Some of my hair is covering my eyes, so I brush it aside. I get out of bed and walk to a nearby mirror.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ISearchElodiesMemory" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the mirror, I see that I'm a young, adolescent girl. This would be a good time to know more about my host. I concentrate and am able to access basic parts of my host's memory. I can't get any specific memories, really, just enough general information for me to understand who I am. It seems that I am now Élodie Noël, or "Ellie" for short. I was born to a father from the mainland and a mother from the eastern continent. I am currently in eighth grade at St. Josephine's Secondary School, which is a non-state boarding school that serves grades 6-12.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IDressSlowly" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Don't take too long getting dressed," smiles the other girl in the room. That girl is Carleigh Lexington, apparently a good friend of mine. Carleigh has a brother, Hewitt, who also attends St. Josephine's.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5INodAtCarleigh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Right," I nod at Carleigh.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IDressElodie" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I change out of my pajamas into my school uniform. It takes a few minutes to put on everything. When I'm done, I see myself in a dress shirt with a blazer and a necktie. I'm also wearing a tartan skirt, medium-length socks, and color-matching shoes. I have to admit, I actually like this look, but … what situation have I put myself in? Back when I startled that police officer when I first got my ability, I was intimidating, I was powerful. Now, who am I? Some schoolgirl? Eh, this feels like a downgrade. At least, like this, I'll have an easy time staying beneath suspicion.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IEnterLiteratureClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh and I have the same first class: literature; so we go to the classroom together. In class, the instructor greets us, saying "Good morning, class! Today, I have a short story to share with you, called 'Paul and the Troubles of Peer Pressure'. Everyone, get into your reading groups, and I'll pass out the story. Read it with your group, share your thoughts, and fill out the questionnaire that I have right here, when you're done."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IReadPaulsStory" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I get into a group consisting of Carleigh and a couple of her friends. The story is about a boy, named "Paul", who succumbs to peer pressure and tries to imitate and fit in with the popular students at his school. Near the end, the wise adults tell him to be himself, since trying to be like another person wouldn't make him happy. Basically, the story tells its message in the most heavy-handed way possible. After our group reads the story, we discuss its meaning.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5WhyDidPaulWantToFitIn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh reads aloud the questionnaire that the instructor had handed out. "First question: 'Why did Paul want to fit in with his peers?'"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5BadWriting" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Because of bad writing?" asks Carleigh's friend.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5PutWhatTeacherWants" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure, but let's put something that the teacher wants to read."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5PaulHadNothingUnique" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, because … Paul didn't feel like he had anything unique about him?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5SureCarleighWrites" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure, I'll write that."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5WasPaulJustified" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Second question: 'On a scale from one to ten, how justified were Paul's actions?' I'll answer this one. Three."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5WhyBeYourself" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ugh, this class activity is terrible. I never felt peer pressure as my old self, even when I was younger. I never understood this issue. Carleigh continues, "Final question: 'What is the number one reason why you should be yourself?' Ellie, do you want to answer this one?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5SureISay" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YouCannotLowerYourself" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"The number one reason why you should be yourself is …

… that you can't play to your strengths if you lower yourself to someone else's level."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CannotAssociateWithLowlyPeople" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, you can't associate with those lowly people," says Carleigh jokingly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YouNeedToStayConfident" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"The number one reason why you should be yourself is …

… that it's how you keep your self-confidence and stay happy."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CarleighWasTeased" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You have a point, but we all have been teased for being ourselves," sighs Carleigh.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YouAvoidStupidity" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"The number one reason why you should be yourself is …

… that you might follow someone stupid. If you know your role model isn't stupid, then it's okay to not be yourself, because the role model is obviously doing something right."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IAmPragmatic" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Being pragmatic, eh? Interesting answer," says Carleigh.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5WasActivityTerrible" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Done," says Carleigh. Phew, finally. I ask my groupmates if they thought that this activity was terrible too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5WriterThinksKidsAreDumb" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, whoever wrote this thinks kids like us are dumb, like we can't think for ourselves," replies Carleigh's friend.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IPassByCheerleader" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Class finally ends, and I go through the halls to my second class. On my way, I pass by an older girl in a cheerleading uniform.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CheerleaderTripsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The girl looks at me and trips me. "Why don't you go back to your own country, dweeb?" she laughs. Ugh, I don't have time to deal with her now, so I move on.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5HewittConsolesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A few more hours pass until lunch break. I head to the cafeteria and buy lunch. I find Carleigh and Hewitt at a table, and I sit and eat with them. Hewitt looks at me, "One of my sister's friends said that she saw a cheerleader be mean to you. If that happens, don't worry about it; those people are just jealous, and they don't deserve your attention."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CheerleaderIsJealous" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You're right, they are just jealous," I say, agreeing with Hewitt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CanIStudyWithCarleigh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, Ellie," adds Carleigh, "can you help me study with a math test?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IEnterLibrary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I know I've technically never met Carleigh until today, but it feels like I've known her for a long time. I can't let her down. I have to help her. "Yeah, I can help you with math," I say. We finish our lunch, and Carleigh and I go to the school library.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ISeeCarleighsTextbook" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh opens her math textbook and shows it to me. The math looks familiar to me. As a scientist, I use math on a somewhat regular basis. The only difference is that, in the professional field, I do mathematics with a computer. Here in school, I'll have to do that math by hand. Hopefully, my written math skills haven't faded away yet. "Are you ready to help?" whispers Carleigh.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IPrepareToPossessCarleigh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yes," I whisper back. What Carleigh doesn't realize is that my help is going to be more … direct than she expects. I look around to see if anyone else in the library is looking at us.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IPossessCarleigh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When it's safe, I jump into Carleigh, possessing her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IExamineCarleigh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look down at myself to see if the possession worked. Everything looks fine. I look over at Élodie. She looks a bit dazed, and I assume that she wasn't conscious while I was possessing her. "Hey … Ellie, we're in the library. Let's go outside," I whisper.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ILeaveLibrary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"What?" Élodie yawns. I let Élodie lean on my shoulder, and I walk her out of the library.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5WhyIsElodieHere" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Why are we here?" asks Élodie.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ElodieIsExhausted" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"It's noontime. You and I were working hard in class earlier. If you don't remember anything, then it's probably from all of the exhaustion," I lie to her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ElodieIsDizzy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, Carleigh. I'm dizzy. I need to sit down. Maybe we can talk after classes. I'm sorry."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IEnterMathClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The bell rings. I brush my hair back, straighten my necktie and blazer, and head to my math class.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IStartMathTest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once class starts, the math instructor passes out the test and asks the class to be quiet. I read over the test and then write "my" name at the top of the paper. "Carleigh Lexington", I think that I spelt that right. Now, onto the test.</value>

    <value>I walk up to the girl and possess her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IDressAnanya" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I am now Ananya Sanjeet. I am in eleventh grade, and I am a member of my school's track and field club. I finish taking off my current uniform and put on the T-shirt and athletic shorts that were in my locker. After doing so, some of my hair falls in front of my face. I also notice that I have a hair tie on my wrist.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ITieAnanyasHair" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Since I don't want to constantly adjust my hair during physical education, I use the tie to tie my hair in a ponytail. I look in the mirror in my locker, and it seems that I did a fairly decent job. I lock my locker and head to the gym.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IEnterPEClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>When gym class begins, we line up for attendance. I see the cheerleader in the line across from mine. I narrow my eyes and smirk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachLectures" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After attendance, the coach begins his lecture, "You are all bright young men and women, and you have the rest of your lives ahead of you. Today, I am going to teach you some basic self-defense so that you can keep that life safe. As many of you know, almost all of the industrialized world bans civilians from possessing firearms, including our country. It's been like this for over a decade, and it has been keeping us safe. Now, some rural areas are exempt from the firearms ban, but we won't be focusing on those today. Anyway, the problem is that criminals have an obvious tendency of not playing by the rules. It is possible, even if not likely, that, one day, one of them will use a gun to threaten you. Can anyone tell me what they would do if a criminal threatened them with a gun?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IRaiseHand" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I have a good answer to this question. I raise my hand, and the coach calls on me, "Yes, Ananya?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IWouldSubmit" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I would just listen to what the criminal says."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachRespondsToSubmission" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Ananya probably did the smartest thing," the coach says. "When staying alive is your priority, you don't necessarily need to be a hero. Compliance might seem cowardly to some of you, but it's really not. Even if the criminal decides to rob you, for example, losing whatever cash you had on hand is a small price to pay for saving your life, and the police might be able help you once you're safe and are able to contact them."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IWouldRun" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I would run away."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachRespondsToRunning" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"So Ananya decided to run away before the criminal could hurt her," the coach says. "It really depends on where you are, but this is generally one of the worse options. In an open area, running away can immediately be a costly mistake. Even in an area with more cover, the criminal can react to you fleeing and shoot you in a matter of seconds. Remember, guns are ranged weapons."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IDisagreeWithCoach" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The coach disagrees with me, but even still, he's not in a position to give advice on that type of self-defense.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IWouldDisarm" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I would twist the gun out of his hand and attack him."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachRespondsToDisarming" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"So Ananya decided to be bold and overpower our bad guy," the coach says. "If, and only if, you are sure that you are stronger than the criminal, then disarming him becomes a possible option. If you succeed, then you can gain control of the situation. However, more often than not, victims who attempt this fail. In fact, last year, two out of every five gun-related deaths here in the western continent were due to over-confidence of the victim. Be careful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachStartsSpar" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Thank you, Ananya. Okay, class, we're going to practice defensive martial arts. Everyone, take the mats that are rolled up on the wall over there and lay them across the gym floor." We all lay out the mats as instructed and we take off our shoes. "All right, now find a partner and practice what we did last time."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IPartnerWithCheerleader" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Without hesitation, I walk up to the cheerleader and ask her if she wants to spar with me. At first, she looks at me weirdly. "Uh … okay, I guess," she shrugs. We start off by exchanging some light punches between each other.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CheerleaderAndISpar" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My spar with the cheerleader gets more intense as we both concentrate. Eventually, the cheerleader tries to hook me, but she's too slow. I dodge to her side, grab her shoulder, and …</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IPinCheerleader" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>… I carefully pin the cheerleader to the floor mat.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachCheersMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Nice counter, Ananya!" says the coach. I help the cheerleader up, but she sneers at me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IKickCheerleader" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>… I kick the cheerleader in the leg.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CheerleaderFalls" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I hear the cheerleader's blood vessels crack. "Ow!" yells the cheerleader, dropping to the mat.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IBringCoachToCheerleader" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I run to the coach and say, "Coach! My partner is hurt. Can you take a look?" The coach follows me to the cheerleader.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachAsksWhatHappened" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"What happened?" he asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CheerleaderIsBruised" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"This Ananya dweeb kicked me! Now my calf is going to be all bruised!" she whines.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IApologizeToCheerleader" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"It was an accident. I'm so sorry," I say, feigning concern. The coach helps her stand up. "I hope you get better," I lie to her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CoachTellsMeToBeCareful" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Ananya, be more careful next time," says the coach.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5INodAtCoach" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, I will," I nod.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5PEClassEnds" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A few minutes later, the coach instructs us to go back to our locker rooms and change before the bell rings so that we can get to our next classes on time.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IDispossessAnanya" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Instead of going to the locker room, however, I jog over to the dormitories, stand under the window of Élodie's room, and jump out of Ananya and fly through the window.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IHideInTheCloset" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>No one's here yet. I hide in the closet for a couple of hours. Eventually, Élodie comes into the bedroom and lies on the bed.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IRepossessElodie" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I should probably possess Élodie now, before Carleigh comes back too, so I do.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IRelax" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After possessing Élodie, I stay lying on the bed for a bit longer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ICallCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh still isn't back yet. I might as well call Caitlyn and Yukio and let them know what I've been doing. After all, they're probably already worried that I'm not at the Arcticon Research Facility. If I call them when Carleigh comes back, it'll be awkward if she overhears me. Otherwise, if I don't call them at all today, then Caitlyn and Yukio will just get more worried.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IGreetCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello, Caitlyn. It's me, Dr. Kaden, again."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5AmIOK" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Kadey? Where are you? Who are you? Are you okay?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ITellCaitlynAboutSchool" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, I'm fine. I'm … uh …" Oh, this is a problem. I'm not sure if I should tell Caitlyn about the native gods who were talking to me. "I left Arcticon to get some fresh air. Some people were nearby, and they were about to see me, so I possessed the nearest person whom I could find, and I ended up becoming an adolescent girl. I can't come back until … it's safe and no one can see me. Maybe a couple of days."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CaitlynOffersToDrive" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, I'm sorry to hear you're stuck like that. Do you want me to drive you back here now, Kadey? We can pretend that you're my daughter. I'd be fine with that."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IDeclineCaitlynsOffer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"There's no need, Caitlyn. I just realized that I can fly through Arcticon's ventilation system to enter and leave as I please."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5OK" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YukioWantsToTalk" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Wait, Kadey," Caitlyn says, "Yuki is right here with me. He wants to talk to you."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YukioGreetsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello? Kaden?" asks Yukio.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IGreetYukio" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello," I reply.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YukioDislikesMeGettingFreshAir" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I do not believe that 'getting fresh air' is a sufficient excuse to not come to work."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IWillCallSupervisor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I groan. "Listen, Yukio," I say, "if it makes you feel better, then I'll call our supervisor and say that I'm on a field study."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IAmApathetic" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Do so. Also, Kaden, you might not believe me, but I wanted to work well with you, just like Caitlyn does. However, you have shown apathy towards other people, and continuing to be apathetic will hurt you."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IApologizeToYukio" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, fine, Yukio. I've wanted to complete this project for years, and I've only just completed it two days ago. If I haven't been focusing on the needs of other people recently, then I'm sorry. That's just how it is."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YukioDismissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Goodbye, Kaden," sighs Yukio.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5YukioIsWrong" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I go back to lying on my bed. Yukio said that I don't care about other people, but that's not true. I mean, I helped Carleigh earlier with math. Yeah, I'm not a selfless caregiver or anything, but still, what does Yukio do that makes him think that's he's better than me?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IThinkTooLong" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Eh, I've gone on long enough.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CarleighReturns" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh eventually comes back. "Hey Ellie," she says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5HowWasCarleighsMath" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hey Carleigh," I say. "How did your math test go?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CarleighForgets" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"This might sound weird," she says, "but I'm actually not sure. I barely even remember being in math class. Around when you were helping me, things seemed to go by like a blur. I was even about to go to PE class at the wrong time. It sounds silly. I know."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CarleighWillBeStar" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, I hope that I was able to turn you into St. Josephine's new star student," I laugh.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ElodieCanBeCool" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Shut up, Ellie," Carleigh laughs back, embarrassed. "Anyway, I have to admit, you can be pretty cool sometimes."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CarleighAndILaugh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Only sometimes, huh?" I ask, smiling. "Okay, well … I'll still take it as a compliment." We both keep laughing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5HewittCallsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Later, in the evening, my phone rings. "Hello? Ellie? It's Hewitt."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IGreetHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hey, Hewitt," I reply.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5CanIHangOutWithHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Thanks for helping my sister today. You've always been a great friend to both of us. Hey, since tomorrow's the last day before the field trip, do you think you can hang out with me after class?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5IMightHangOutWithHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, this caught me off guard. I'm supposed to be meeting those gods, not to go on some playdate. On the other hand, I don't want to let Hewitt down. "Maybe, Hewitt," I say. "I'll let you know my decision tomorrow at lunch."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch5ISleep" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It gets late, and we decide to go to sleep.</value>

  <data name="ch6TimeAgo" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>11 years ago …</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6IDatedRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I was on a week-long break from school. That evening, Rebecca and I went out to eat dinner together. We walked to the main city square. The weather was cool. The signs on the surrounding buildings were so colorful and brightly lit that it contrasted so well with the dark sky.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6RebeccaPhotographedUs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rebecca even took a photograph of us standing in front of Main Avenue.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6WeWentToRestaurant" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We got hungry. "Hey Alex," Rebecca smiled, holding my hand. "How about that restaurant?' she asked, pointing with her other hand. I agreed, and we went in there.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6WeAte" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We were seated at a booth. I ordered a toasted ham sandwich, and Rebecca ordered a lean chicken salad. Both of our meals were seasoned with the west's signature herbs. Everything was just about perfect. "Have any plans for the rest of our break?" Rebecca asked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6IWillCompute" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Nah, I'll just be using my computer."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6RebeccaWillPostPhoto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, well, I'll be with my other friends, and I'll be sure to tell them all about this. Speaking of computers, though, I'll probably post our picture online to my friends. I can send it to you, too, if you want."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch6IKissedRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We finished our meals. I thanked Rebecca for going out with me and gave her a quick kiss. She hesitated. "Okay, lover boy," she joked, "we should go home before it gets even darker," and so we left.</value>

  <data name="ch7SleepyHead" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Good morning, again, Sleepy Head!"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7ISnoreAtSezja" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, it's you again?" I snore.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WasSezjaCarleigh" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Wait, you're in Carleigh! Were you her the whole time?" I ask Carleigh, who is obviously possessed by Sezja.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaFingersChin" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Maybe, maybe not," Sezja-as-Carleigh says, with her finger on her chin … with his finger on his chin … with Sezja placing Carleigh's finger on Carleigh's chin. You get the idea.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaAsBestFriend" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stare in shock at Sezja. "Ooh! You should see the look on your face! It's so cute!" he says. "Seriously though, I just possessed this girl this morning," he admits. "Oh, but this is so great! We can be best friends forever, like I've always dreamt of!"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaHugsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sezja runs towards me and hugs me, squeezing my chest in the process. Seriously, he's squeezing my chest. I think he's doing it on purpose, too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WhyIsSezjaHere" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"So, why are you here?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaStaysWithMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, my brother asked me to visit you to see if you were adjusting well. You're obviously just fine. I'm supposed to be heading back now, but … I think I'll stay with you, for fun!" Sezja-as-Carleigh enthuses.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7CanSezjaActNormal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Can you at least act normal if you're going to be Carleigh?" I ask. Sezja shrugs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IReturnToLiteratureClass" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In literature class, I get back into my group from yesterday. The instructor passes back the group paper that the real Carleigh and her friends wrote with me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7LostCreditForLoweringSelvesForLiterture" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Aw, we lost two-thirds credit on the last problem," Carleigh's friend says. "The teacher didn't like how we said 'lower ourselves to someone else's level'."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7LiteratureTeacherIsDrag" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Ugh, this teacher is such a drag anyway," says Carleigh's other friend.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7FullCreditForLiterature" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hey, we got full credit. Nice!" Carleigh's friend says. "I guess the teacher bought the 'be happy' crap that we wrote for the last problem."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7CarleighsGroupCheers" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Good job, girls," says Carleigh's other friend.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7LostCreditForNotBeingOneselfForLiterature" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Aw, we lost two-thirds credit on the last problem," Carleigh's friend says. "The teacher didn't like how we said 'it's okay to not be yourself'."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaIsQuiet" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sezja doesn't speak much as Carleigh, though that's probably for the best.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7MorningPasses" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The rest of my classes before lunch go fine. I don't share any of those classes with Carleigh, so I'm just hoping that Sezja isn't ruining Carleigh's image.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7LunchBegins" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, it's lunchtime. I promised Hewitt that I would tell him whether I wanted to go out with him. I go to the dining area and see Hewitt eating some chicken strips. I sit in front of him. "Hello, Hewitt." Hewitt looks up at me. "I've thought about when you asked me to hang out with you later this afternoon. My answer is …"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IAcceptHangout" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"… yes. I'd be fine with hanging out."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IDeclineHangout" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"… no. I'm sorry, Hewitt, but I'm busy today."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerBurpsAtMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, whatever, Babe," burps Hewitt, with food still in his mouth. Gross! "Now buy me some dessert. This chicken isn't filling me up," he demands.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerIsJerk" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Ugh, you're such a jerk," I remark.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7HewittActsDifferent" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stand up and walk away. I don't get it. Hewitt seemed all right yesterday. Today, he seems like a completely different person … oh no.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalCallsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I pass by the dormitories on my walk. "Psst! Dr. Kaden, I have wanted to meet you," says a voice.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerReturns" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn to my side and see a woman standing behind the dormitory building. I walk towards her. Upon closer inspection, I notice that she is leafy and green and is wearing tribal clothing. Before either of us is able to talk, I hear Hewitt shouting behind me, "Hey Babe, I said get me a dessert! Why are you taking your sweet time?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerNoticesVaNal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hewitt runs up to me, but then notices the woman next to me. "Sister?" says Hewitt, puzzled.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7HewittDoesNotDeserveBaqer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Brother, that boy does not deserve a slob, like you, to possess him."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalDaresToWatchBaqer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You were watching me, Sister? How dare you follow me around!" snaps Hewitt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerFollowedMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hey, you're only here because you must have been following me around," I say to Hewitt, interjecting.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerGrabsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"No one was talking to you, Princess!" says Hewitt, grabbing me by the shirt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalPullsBaqer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Stop!" yells the woman. She reaches out to Hewitt, and her hands go inside of him. When that happens, Hewitt lets go of me and shrieks in pain.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalSeperatesBaqer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Eventually, the woman pulls something out of Hewitt. It's a man! A large, heavy man is being pulled out of Hewitt. The man is wearing no clothing, except for a grass skirt. Eventually, the woman completely separates the man from Hewitt's body. Hewitt himself then collapses to the ground.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7BaqerFlees" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Let you be cursed, Sister! I'm going home!" yells the man, as he runs out of sight.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7CanIPossessHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I am sorry that you witnessed that," says the woman. "My brother lacks discipline. In addition, my brother's yelling may have attracted attention. I do not want others to see me like this. Dr. Kaden, would you be all right with switching into that boy over there?" she asks, pointing at Hewitt.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SureINod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure," I nod.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalPossessesElodie" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>As I possess Hewitt, I notice the woman dissolving into a black vapor. After I've fully possessed Hewitt, the woman absorbs herself into Élodie. After that, Élodie blinks, feels for her own face, and looks down at herself. "Ah yes, this is good," says Élodie. "Please, Dr. Kaden, let us eat lunch together before the period ends," she says. She grabs my hand and takes me to the cafeteria.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WeBuyHam" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At the cafeteria, I order a ham sandwich. Élodie orders a ham sandwich as well. "This lunch will be my treat, Dr. Kaden," she says, offering to pay.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WeEatHam" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We eat at a table. Our sandwiches are cold, but I wasn't expecting much from a school cafeteria anyway. "So, I take it that you and your brother are more of these gods that I keep meeting," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalIntoducesHerself" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yes, Dr. Kaden. I am Va'Nal, the goddess of romance. My brother whom you just met is Baqer. All of us gods love each other, even though Baqer can be a handful."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WhyWillIGoToRuins" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I see, but haven't I met all of you now? Why do I need to go to your ancient city if you're all just going to stop by and say 'hi' to me anyway?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7GoingWillMakeSense" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Dr. Kaden, it will make sense when the time comes."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaReturns" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I see Carleigh coming towards us. "Hello again, Best Friend," Carleigh says to Va'Nal-as-Élodie. It seems that Sezja is still possessing Carleigh, but doesn't realize that I'm Hewitt now and that Élodie is actually Va'Nal. Sezja-as-Carleigh sits next to Va'Nal-as-Élodie and smiles at her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaCallsVaNalBestFriend" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I have never heard you call me 'Best Friend', brother," says Va'Nal.</value>

    <value>"Oh! Sister! Is that you? I'm so sorry," says a shocked Sezja.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IAmHere" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"It is all right," says Va'Nal. "Your friend is over there," she says, pointing at me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaGreetsMeAgain" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello again, best friend," Sezja says, now looking towards me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7CanSezjaGetCarleighsTest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello," I say back. "Sezja, can you remember to get Carleigh's math paper?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WhyDoIAskSezja" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Uh … sure. Why are you asking?" Sezja asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7ITookCarleighsTest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I helped Carleigh with her math test. Well, really, I just took the test for her," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7SezjaGetsNervousTalking" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hey, hey, that was sweet of you. You really are a most bestest friend!" Sezja says. "You seem excited to get your grade back, Best Friend. You can come with me to math class. You can even do the talking. I get nervous talking to most mortals, anyway."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IGetCarleighsTest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The bell rings as Sezja and I enter the room for Carleigh's math class. We approach the instructor. "Hi, I'm here to get the test back for my sister, Carleigh Lexington." The instructor looks through all of the students' papers and hands me mine, well, Carleigh's. "Thanks," I say, and Sezja and I leave the room.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IScore10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My score is 10/10. That's perfect! The real Carleigh will love this when she finds out.</value>

  <data name="ch7IScore9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My score is 9/10. That's great! The real Carleigh will love this when she finds out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IScore8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My score is 8/10. That's good. I wonder how the real Carleigh will feel when she finds out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IScore7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My score is 7/10. I answered all of the difficult questions incorrectly. I hope that I don't let down the real Carleigh too much when she finds out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7AfternoonPasses" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Time passes as I attend the rest of Hewitt's classes. I do overhear some students talk about the upcoming field trip from time to time, but otherwise, nothing too special happens.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalEntersDorm" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>By the evening, I've come to my new dormitory and am now lying on my bed. I hear my bedroom door being opened. I look over and see Élodie entering the room, her blazer now off. "Va'Nal?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7ElodieIsVaNal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yes, it is still I," she responds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7HowDidVaNalEnter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"How did you come into the boys' dormitories?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalPitiesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"A goddess knows her way around," she smiles. "Look at yourself, Dr. Kaden. You are a boy lying on his bed, all alone. It has been years for you, and yet little has changed."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WhatDoesVaNalMean" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"What do you mean?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7ISeekCompanionship" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You seek companionship. Do you not, Dr. Kaden? I can see into your heart. You think of older days. You think of … her. It is not healthy. No matter whose body you are in, your heart remains the same. You need to stop thinking of her before it is too late. I can help."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalStrokesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>She strokes my forehead. "For both of our happiness … kiss me."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IDoNotKissVaNal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I can't kiss you, Va'Nal."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WhatIsWrong" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"What is wrong?" Va'Nal asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7WrongAge" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"If I wanted a girlfriend, then I would find someone my own age, with my own body," I remind her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IAmHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"But you are Hewitt now, and I am Élodie. We can be together," Va'Nal says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalDisintrestsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I am not interested. I'm sorry, but I'm just not. Please, I'd like to be alone for the rest of the night," I say, nodding towards the door.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalAdmitsDisrespect" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Va'Nal looks sad. "You are right. We would have been disrespecting our hosts anyway," she admits.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7IWillKissVaNal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Only if you're sure that kissing will help me."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7HeartMustBeCared" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Of course. The heart is like any other part of the body. It needs to be cared for. I want you to stay well."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7OKINod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay," I nod.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalKissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Va'Nal leans towards me and kisses. Afterwards, Va'Nal asks, "Well, 'Hewey', how do you feel?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7VaNalLeavesBed" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I feel better. Thank you, Va'Nal," I smile. She smiles back.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch7GodsWillDispossess" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Before I leave, I want you to know that we will be at our home, expecting you to meet us. Your classmates will be their normal selves, so be careful about what you tell them," Va'Nal says.</value>

    <value>"Understood," I say, and Va'Nal walks out the door.</value>

  <data name="ch8INeededHelpWithReport" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I had to write a book report by next week. I could have written it by myself, but let's face it; I was never good with writing papers. It was lunchtime. I walked around the campus, looking for familiar students from my literature class.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8IMetSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I saw Sarah Parson sitting by herself, writing in a journal. I walk up to her. "Hey, Sarah …" I said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8SarahAskedColdly" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah looked up at me. "Did you need something?" she coldly asked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8DidSarahKnowMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You know me, right? I'm Alexander Kaden, from literature class," I said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8OKAndSarahAsked" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, and …?" she asked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8IAskedSarahForHelp" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, you know how our book report is due next week, right? I know that you're really good with reading and writing. I was wondering if we could meet up after class sometime this week and talk about the book. Would that be okay? I could keep you company," I smiled.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8SarahDeclinesHelping" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Alex," she said, "I don't know you that well. Asking me to help is too much."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8RebeccaCouldNotHelp" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, okay," I responded. "I asked Rebecca earlier to help me, but she said that she couldn't, because she wasn't reading the same book in her literature class."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8DidIKnowRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You know Rebecca?" Sarah asked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8IDatedRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, we've been going out together for a long time now," I said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8SarahAgreedToHelp" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh," Sarah said, worried. "Listen, Alex, I'll help you, but only this one time."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8Thanks" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Thanks."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8ILookedAtSarahsJournal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I looked at her journal again. "You really like to write in that. Are you planning to study anything writing-related in university?" I asked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8SarahStudiedJournalism" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'm going to study journalism, actually," Sarah said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8IWishedSarahLuck" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sounds cool. Good luck with that," I said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch8SarahThankedMe" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch9IAwaken" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Today's the field trip. I change out of my pajamas into a casual, camping outfit, since I don't need to wear my school uniform for this. Besides, this outfit will be a better job of keeping me mobile.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IWaitForBus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I head out of the dormitories to the bus stop in front of the school. Everyone from the school's sixth, seventh, and eighth grades is here. It's a huge mass of students. I do eventually find Carleigh and Élodie. "I'm glad that you made it out here in time. I'd hate to tell Mom that you slept while the buses left," laughs Carleigh.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9CarleighLikesHewittSleeping" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You'd probably like it if I had slept, wouldn't you, Sis?" I respond.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ElodieWouldMissHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh shakes her head, "No, of course not. If you did, then Ellie would just spend the whole trip talking about how you weren't here." Élodie shyly nods.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IBoardBus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Several large buses stop by the campus to pick us up. Our names are checked off on a list as we enter the buses, one by one. The whole process of everyone boarding the buses takes nearly half an hour, but then, there are a lot of students, so it's reasonable to take that long.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9DidCarleighTalkAboutMathTest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Eventually, our bus drives away from St. Josephine and towards New Ferando's highway. Carleigh, Élodie, and I are all sitting together, and we talk during the bus ride. "Hey Ellie, did I ever tell you about my math test?" Carleigh asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9CarleighScored10" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I scored 10/10. That'll really boost my grade! Maybe I'll be the new star student, after all. Thanks, Ellie."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9CarleighScored9" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I scored 9/10. That'll really boost my grade! Thanks, Ellie."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9CarleighScored8" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I scored 8/10. I think that's pretty good. Thanks, Ellie."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9CarleighScored7" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I only scored 7/10. It's mainly my fault though. I spaced out a bit while you were helping me. I guess I can do that when I'm nervous. Still, thanks, Ellie."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9OhElodieSays" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh," Élodie says, a bit confused.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BusExitsHighway" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The bus takes an exit on the highway. "We're almost there," says a school staffer. We drive on a road surrounded by trees.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BusPassesCheckpoint" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Up ahead is a secured checkpoint with park rangers. The bus stops at the checkpoint, and the staffer briefly gets out and talks to the gatekeeper. The staffer comes back onto the bus, and we continue driving.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IExitBus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We finally reach a lodge. The bus stops and drops us off here. It takes another 10 minutes for the rest of the buses and students to finally arrive.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9GuideAnnounces" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once everyone's here, an adult with a megaphone, presumably our field trip guide, stands in front of the large group. He says, "Greetings, St. Josephine's Secondary School. This is the Western Continental Park, home to a few endangered species, as well as to the ruined ancient settlements of the native people. This building next to me is the main guest lodge. The lodge has common areas that you are all welcome to use during free time. There are also bedrooms upstairs, but there are only enough bedrooms for the grownups. Sorry kids, but you'll have to sleep in tents. The park staff will be setting up your tents throughout the day. I'll talk more about that in the evening. For now, you kids have an hour while we get everything set up. Now would be a good time to have a snack and take care of any personal business. We're going to be doing a lot of walking, so be prepared."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9MuchBuildup" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There is so much buildup here, and for what? I just need an opportunity to get into the ancient city ruins. Once I get there, I meet up with the native gods, do whatever they want me to do, and then I ditch this place.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IEnterLodge" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I enter the lodge and go to its living room. There's a television set tuned to the news channel. I decide to watch.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9SarahStartsInterview" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah Parson is on the screen. She's sitting in the network's interview room. "So, what happened? From the beginning?" Sarah asks the off-screen interviewee.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9OfficerTalks" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The screen cuts to the interviewee. "I was on my regular patrol," says the interviewed man. "I was walking on the sidewalk, passing by several alleys, when I heard a man coughing violently. I looked into the next alley, and I saw the man. He was wearing a blue hooded raincoat and was kneeling down on the ground. I asked him if he was all right. He looked up at me. I couldn't see his face. Everything inside his hood was black. Then, two red, glowing eyes showed up, where his face should've been. After that, he jumped at me and knocked me unconscious. The only thing I could remember after that was me waking up just outside my apartment building."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ISeeMySketch" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The screen fades to a sketch of me in my spirit form, with red eyes and everything. The sketch is accompanied by Sarah's voiceover, telling viewers that if they have any information regarding me, that they should call the New Ferando Police Department.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9SarahSignsOut" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The screen then fades to Sarah, this time sitting at a desk on the main news set. "That interview was recorded earlier today. We'll have more this evening. Until then, you've been watching New Ferando Network News on KNFN. Thanks for tuning in."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9PublicKnowsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Well, this isn't good. Now the whole public knows about me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9WeStartWalk" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Free time is over, and we're separated into groups, each lead by a tour guide. We embark on a long nature walk all over the park.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9WeFindIvy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We pass by poison ivy. "That's poison ivy over there, kids. Don't touch," the guide says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9WeFindPolecats" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>On our walk, we see polecats climbing nearby trees. "See those critters in the trees?" the tour guide asks. "Those are polecats. They originate from the mainland. Several centuries ago, some explorers from the mainland brought polecats into this continent. We've been keeping the migrated polecats safe here in the park. Nowadays, most polecats have been domesticated into ferrets, and ferrets have become popular household pets."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9WeFindSnakes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Later on in the walk, we see snakes slithering on the ground. "Careful, kids. Some snakes are venomous. You kids know how to tell whether they're venomous, right? My old co-worker Billy told me this saying: 'black and yellow, friendly fellow; red and black, get back'." I'm not a snake expert, but our tour guide might have gotten that mnemonic wrong. It's okay, though. He's only endangering a dozen students.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9WeSeeRuins" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We finally pass by a view of the ancient native city, from the side of a hill. "See that ruined city in the distance?" the guide asks. "That was the capital of the western continent's indigenous people. We won't be entering the city. In fact, we prefer to leave the city's architecture undisturbed, so we generally only allow entry during research expeditions." Well, that means that this is as far as I'm going to get as a normal person.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ShouldIRun" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hm, should I run for it? I doubt that I can do it without getting noticed, but I might as well make the most out of this opportunity.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IDispossessHewitt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I move to the back of the group. When the guide is looking away from the students, I quietly run behind a nearby tree. I dispossess Hewitt and fly through the trees towards the city.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9GuideSeesBlackBear" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Woah, stand back, kids!" says the tour guide, surprised. "That looked like a black bear. Generally, those bears stay away from us humans, especially adult bears. That bear might have been an adolescent, though, so it might not have learned how dangerous humans are yet. Also, did you know that, unlike polecats, black bears are native to the western continent? It's true!"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IEnterRuins" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I finally reach the ancient city. It's filled with unoccupied stone buildings. I see the largest building in the city. It's a giant step pyramid, also made out of stone. I fly up the main stairs of the pyramid. At the top is a ritual room … with the four gods lounging around inside.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BaqerGreetsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello, False Spirit. My brother called you that, right?" asks Baqer. "You were also that girl from school, weren't you? The one who was too lazy to get me dessert. Ah, it's typical of your kind. You take, you take, you take. You take our dignity. You take our blood. And what do you give in return? Nothing."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ICanRedeem" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Now, now, Brother," says Bek'Shtii, "Dr. Kaden may be a false spirit, but he can still be our ally if he redeems himself."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BaqerCannotTrustMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Nuh-uh, this Kaden guy is a perfect example of why his kind isn't to be trusted!" Baqer shouts back.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiiAndBaqerYell" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Bek'Shtii and Baqer yell at each other. Sezja gets upset. "Why do you brothers have to argue? This is supposed to be our happy place," Sezja cries.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9GodsAreFlawed" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Amidst all of this, Va'Nal walks towards me. "I am sorry that you have to see this. Our family is not so different than a mortal family, is it?" she says, holding my shoulder, trying to comfort me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9VaNalsKissIsRuined" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I had hoped that what you and I did yesterday evening would put you in a good mood, but it seems that Baqer just has to ruin it," Va'Nal says, frowning.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9GodsAreInappropriate" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I am sorry if Baqer is making you uncomfortable. He does not know how to act appropriately amongst mortals. I suppose that I do not know how to act appropriately either, considering how I behaved towards you yesterday evening," Va'Nal says, frowning.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiisNewPlan" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, okay, here is the plan now," Bek'Shtii says. "Dr. Kaden, you appeared on television earlier today, did you not?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9YesIAdmit" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yes," I admit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9HowDidBekShtiiKnow" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Wait, how did you know that?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiiWillEmpower" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Do not overthink," says Bek'Shtii. "Nevertheless, if that is the case, then I shall expand your powers, to increase survivability. I only ask that you stay still while I recite a chant."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiiChants" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Bek'Shtii then chants in a language with which I'm not familiar. Everyone else stands back silently.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BeckShtiiFinishesChant" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>My gaseous form begins to ache. It feels like it's condensing. I fall onto my knees. Eventually, Bek'Shtii finishes his chant. I breathe heavily, recovering from the discomfort.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ISolidify" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I feel for my face. I can feel it. My face is fleshy and solid. My normal, actual face is back. "Dr. Kaden, you can now switch between your natural, mortal form and your false spirit form freely," Bek'Shtii tells me. I try it, and, sure enough, I can switch between my two forms just by thinking about it. I stay with my mortal form, for the time being.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiiExplainsAbilities" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"This should help you move around unnoticed without having to possess another person," Bek'Shtii says. "You have one more new ability. You can grow tentacles from your back. Try it."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IExtendTentacles" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I try it, and four black, vaporous tentacles come out of my back, two on each side. I can even control them, just like my own arms. "You can do this even when possessing someone. This might be useful in combat, if you ever need to defend yourself," Bek'Shtii says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiiThoughtAhead" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You really thought ahead, didn't you?" I smile.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BekShtiiDismissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I will take that as a 'thank you'," Bek'Shtii responds. "We may need your assistance in the near future. Considering what we have done for you, we find that reasonable. You are free to go," Bek'Shtii says, dismissing me. I turn and walk away.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9SezjaDismissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Have fun with your new powers!" Sezja says excitedly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9VaNalDissmissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Keep your spirits up," reminds Va'Nal.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9BaqerDissmissesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, bye," groans Baqer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ILeaveRuins" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I leave the ancient city and wonder what I will do next. I should probably start by going back home to the Arcticon Research Facility.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IEncounterRanger" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I encounter an armed park ranger. "Are you lost, Sir?" he asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IAmLeaving" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"No, I went to those ruins over there for a meeting. I'm on my way out right now," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9HowDidIEnterPark" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The ranger is confused. "How did you enter this park?" he asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ISneakedOntoBus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I rode a bus with students earlier today to get in here. I'm not actually with the school, though," I answer truthfully.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9RangerMustDetainMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sir, if you're not authorized to be here, then I have to detain you," the ranger says, pointing his gun at me. Okay, I don't need to panic. This reminds me of gym class when I was Ananya Sanjeet. What's the best thing to do in this situation?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IRemember" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>"Don't think about running," says the ranger. Well, so much for that idea. I take another look at the ranger. I might be able to take him on, anyway.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IFalselySurrender" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Turn around and put your hands behind your back," says the ranger. I do so. He approaches me and is about to place restraints on my wrists. Just before he does so, however, I figure that I should take advantage of this.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IStealRangersGun" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I quickly extend tentacles from my back. I use them to quickly grab the ranger's gun away from him.</value>

    <value>I pull out the magazine from the gun and crush the magazine with my tentacles into dust.</value>

  <data name="ch9IReturnGun" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I hand the unloaded gun back to the ranger. "It's a shame that you're just doing your job. Now leave me be," I laugh.</value>

  <data name="ch9WhoAmI" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Who are you?" asks the ranger.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9RangerKnowsMeOnTV" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I change into my spirit form. "I know you! You were on TV! What are you, exactly? What do you want?" the ranger gasps.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IWantToBeLeft" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I already told you what I want. I want you to let me leave," I respond. The ranger backs away from me. "You really want to know who I am, don't you?"</value>

  <data name="ch9IAmPhantomOfWest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I am the Phantom of the West!"</value>

    <value>I reach Arcticon's surface entrance. I see a ventilator nearby, so I use it to enter the ventilation system to reach my apartment.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IReachMyRoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Finally, I'm back in my own bedroom. I should probably tell Caitlyn and Yukio what I've been doing so far. I switch to my mortal form and head out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IGoToLounge" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I head over to the staff lounge that Caitlyn and Yukio frequent. It should be their break time soon, and then they'll be here.</value>

    <value>Break time arrives, and Caitlyn and Yukio enter the lounge shortly thereafter.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="ch9CaitlynAndYukioWorried" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch9YukioSawMeOnTV" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yes, and we also saw a man talk about you on television this morning. Do you care to explain?" Yukio asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9DoesCaitlynRemember" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"The television? Oh, that man was the first person that I possessed. Caitlyn, you remember when you drove to New Ferando to pick me up, right?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9CaitlynRemembersOfficer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn nods, "Yeah, that man was a police officer; wasn't he? He looks familiar now, now that you mention it."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IMayReappearOnTV" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I continue, "Well, that might not be the last time that I'm mentioned on television. Let me explain."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9ISummarizeToYukio" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I tell Caitlyn and Yukio my story. "Okay, so I already told you on the phone how I went outside to get some fresh air, right? And that I was about to be seen and that I had to possess a student? Well, after that phone call, I continued going to school the next day as my new self. Then, the day after that, it turned out that we had to go on a field trip to the Western Continental Park. So, we went there, and we went on a boring hike with some tour guides. In the middle of the hike, gaseous tentacles grew out from my back. It turned out that my powers were expanding. The tour guide got scared and he was about to shoot me, but then I used my tentacles to grab his gun, and I crushed it into tiny bits. Then, I came back here. Also, I can switch between my normal self and my spirit self now."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9YukioSimplifiesMySummary" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, okay. That is a lot of information to give us at once. Let me understand the basics. Essentially, you are becoming more powerful, and you let yet another outsider discover your powers. Is that correct?" asks Yukio.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9YeahBasically" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, basically."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IWaitForFoxtrot" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yukio shakes his head and leaves the lounge. "Don't worry too much about Yuki," says Caitlyn. "Also, it seems like you've had an exhausting day. I know just who can help you relax. Stay right there," Caitlyn adds, and then leaves the lounge.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch9IAlreadyMetFoxtrot" xml:space="preserve">

  <data name="ch9FoxtrotStares" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Foxtrot just stares at me. Foxtrot is usually more forthcoming when he sees me, but he doesn't seem as comfortable this time. Can he smell the god's blood inside of me?</value>

    <value>I decide to leave Foxtrot alone.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="ch9FoxtrotHisses" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch9FoxtrotAllowsPet" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Foxtrot pulls his head back at first as I move my hand towards him. I wait a few moments, and Foxtrot puts his head back forward.</value>

    <value>I rub his head, and he seems all right with it.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="ch10WeFinishedDinner" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn, Yukio, Jim, and I had graduated with our doctoral degrees and were at the Kenyon Imperial Hotel, New Ferando's flagship hotel. We had just finished eating dinner at the Yí Mǐn Cāntīng, an eastern-continent-style restaurant and one of several restaurants in the Kenyon Hotel. We were walking through one of the hotel's major walkways.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10WhereDoesYukioWork" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Where are you going to work?" Jim asked Yukio.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10ArcticonHiredUs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"The Arcticon Research Facility is hiring me as a physicist." Yukio turned to Caitlyn and me. "Actually, all three of us were hired there."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10CaitlynResearchesMedicine" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yup, I'm going to be a medical researcher there," Caitlyn added.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10JimIsAssistantProf" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, well, I guess that leaves me the odd one out," Jim said, scratching his head. "There's a university on the mainland that wants me as an assistant professor. It's going to be tough working without you guys anymore."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10WeMissedJim" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"We'll miss you!" smiles Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10CaitlynNoticesRAF" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn turned around and noticed a sign by the ballroom entrance. "Kadey, look! The Rescued Animals Foundation is hosting an event in the ballroom right now," Caitlyn pointed at the sign, excitedly. "Oh, I bet they have cute animals in there!" she continued.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10WhyDoesCaitlynCallMeKadey" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You've been calling me 'Kadey' a lot recently. How come?" I asked.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10CaitlynLikesToNickname" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, well, I guess I like to nickname people as a way of showing affection. You, Yuki, and Jim are all really great friends," she blushed, embarrassed. "Is it okay if I keep calling you 'Kadey'?" she asked, worried if she was offending me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10IHadNotBeenGoodFriend" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I hesitated. "… Sure, you can keep calling me 'Kadey' if you want. It's been a long time since someone considered me a 'great friend' anyway," I said.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10WeHadGottenWellTogether" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Kaden, you do not need to feel like that. All four of us have gotten along well together, considering all things," Yukio said, smiling.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10WeWentToRAF" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"So, do you want to go in, Kadey?" Caitlyn asked. The Kenyon Imperial Hotel's ballroom was a popular location for hosting events, so I decided to go with Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10WeExploredRAF" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There were many people in the ballroom. Among them were representatives from the Rescued Animals Foundation handing out flyers. There were even posters on the wall that mentioned wrongful deaths and abuses of animals, with some other posters saying how we could make a difference.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10CaitlynLookedAtAnimals" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At the front of the ballroom were rescued domestic animals, with each species enclosed in its own pen. Caitlyn walked along the various pens, and I followed her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10CaitlynWantedFerret" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn stopped at a pen with ferrets. "Oh, they're so cute!" she said. "Let's adopt one! How about that one?" she asked, pointing at one of the ferrets.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10IRejectedFerret" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Come on, Caitlyn. Owning an animal like that is a years-long commitment. We already have ourselves to take care of," I replied.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch10PleaseCaitlynAsked" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Please?" Caitlyn asked, looking innocently at me.</value>

    <value>"I hope that you slept well," Bek'Shtii says. "You're back in my room?" I ask. "I am. Also, you may be interested in this,' he says, handing me an invitation flyer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ReunionWillBeTonight" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The flyer is about a reunion for former students of New Ferando State High School, the same school that I attended many years ago. According to the flyer, the reunion will be held in the Kenyon Imperial Hotel ballroom … late tonight!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ICannotPrepare" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This could be a problem. I don't have much time to prepare. I've already missed several days of work, and I should probably talk to my supervisor about why I'll be gone today as well. I don't have any proper clothes to wear for this type of social event. I haven't even booked a room at the Kenyon Hotel, although perhaps that part isn't as important, since I can fly back here. I also have to deal with Sarah Parson. I bet the park ranger who saw me yesterday is going to run to the media, and Sarah, or a co-worker of hers, will interview him, and my reputation will be ruined.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ICouldPossessSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Wait a minute. Sarah went to high school with me. She might go to the reunion tonight. If so, then I could possess Sarah, bias the interview, and go to the reunion as her. I mean, I don't have to go to the reunion, but I would be possessing Sarah anyway, and I'd bet Sarah would have wanted to go. Also, I might see Rebecca there.</value>
  </data>

    <value>I would really like to see Rebecca there.</value>

    <value>It's almost the start of the workday. I head to the laboratory where Caitlyn, Yukio, and I work.</value>

  <data name="ch11IWantUsToGoToHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello, Caitlyn and Yukio. I'm sorry about all of the worrying that I have caused for either of you. I want to make up for it. I want us to drive to the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. There is a major social event being held there. I will let you see my powers firsthand. How about it?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioIsNotPaidToGoWithMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Kaden," Yukio says, "we are supposed to work in the laboratory today. Caitlyn and I are not being paid to go on field trips with you. Perhaps you should start working again as well."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWillCallSupervisor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, Yukio. I can call our supervisor and get official permission to go to the hotel today. Would you and Caitlyn go with me then?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioShrugs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yukio shrugs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ICallSupervisor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I call our supervisor. "Hello? Supervisor? I might have already called you about this, but the reason that I was absent for the last few days was because of an important field study. I wish to continue my study today, but I also wish for Caitlyn Rylie and Yukio Kiyoshi to accompany me. Is that all right with you?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WeDriveOutOfArcticon" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, thank you." I'm cleared to go out with Caitlyn and Yukio. I tell them the news, and we leave Arcticon to drive off.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioDrivesDownHighway" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yukio is driving Caitlyn and me down the highway. It's overcast and raining today.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11KNFNVanPassesUs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I see a KNFN News van pass by us on the other side of the highway. "Yukio, a news van just headed by us towards the park. I need to check it out. Keep driving with Caitlyn to the Kenyon Hotel. I'll contact you later."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IRollDownWindow" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn into my spirit form and roll down my car window.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="ch11VanStopsAtLodge" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The van eventually stops by the lodge. It's hard to tell, hiding under the news van, but it looks like the students have already left.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11SarahLooksAtMirror" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I see Sarah and the news crew walk out of the vehicle. They talk. Eventually, Sarah walks over to the other side of the van, pulls out a handheld mirror from her pocket, and looks at herself.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IPossessSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I take this opportunity to possess Sarah.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IExamineSarah" xml:space="preserve">

    <value>I go back to the news crew and tell them that I'm ready.</value>

    <value>The news crew calls over the park ranger who tried to detain me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WeStartInterview" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We all get ready for the news report to be filmed, and we go on the air.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11AnchorStarts" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I hear a news anchor on my earphone. "The unidentified man who may have assaulted a New Ferando police officer earlier this week strikes again. Sarah Parson joins us live at the Western Continental Park. Sarah?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IIntroduceRanger" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I respond, "We are here with a park ranger who says that a man attacked him yesterday afternoon." I turn to the ranger. "So, tell us what happened?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11RangerSawMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, a coworker of mine was guiding a tour with a group of students. He called me on the radio, saying he saw a black bear who knocked a student unconscious, and he wanted me to investigate while he continued the tour. When I got there, I saw a man in a blue hooded raincoat. I asked him where he came from, and he started answering real aggressively."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WasIAggressive" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Aggressively? What did he say specifically? Was he just lost or confused?" I interject.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11RangerWasToDetainMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"He said he came from the ruins, but the ruins are off-limits. There's some very fragile architecture there. I told him I had to detain him."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WasIDangerous" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You said that you had to detain him? Was he dangerous? He was not armed or anything, was he?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11StandardProcedure" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"It's just standard procedure, Ma'am. We value our park greatly, and take pride in keeping it safe."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GoOnINod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Understandable. Please, go on," I nod.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ISaidIWasPhantomOfWest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I was about to handcuff him, but then he took my gun and pulled out the magazine and damaged it. Then, his face turned to black, and his eyes glowed red. He told me that he was the 'Phantom of the West', and he ran off."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WhatShouldIKnow" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"He said that his name was the 'Phantom of the West'? I see. One more thing before we go: if this phantom were here now, what would you want him to know?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IShouldTurnIn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'd say he should turn himself in. I don't care what kind of powers he has. He has the obligation to act in a civilized manner, just like anyone else."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11RangerMisunderstoodMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Thank you for your time, and I hope that the encounter between you and this phantom was just a misunderstanding," I say to the ranger, much to his puzzlement.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ISignOff" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn to the camera. "This is Sarah Parson at the Western Continental Park. We will keep you updated with any more news regarding this mysterious, handsome, hooded man, here on KNFN."</value>

    <value>The news crew and I pack up our equipment and return to the van.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11VanDrivesToNewFerando" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We drive south, to New Ferando. I take off my earphone. I then look through Sarah's memories. It seems that she already booked a room at the Kenyon Imperial Hotel so that she wouldn't have to drive in the rain at night and deal with New Ferando's congested traffic. Sarah also asked to have a short workday today, for the reunion. I tell the crew to drop me off at the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. The hotel and the KNFN headquarters are only a couple blocks away from each other, so it's no big deal for them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IExitVan" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We reach the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. I grab my handbag, well, Sarah's. I thank the crew and exit onto the sidewalk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IRegroupWithCaitlynAndYukio" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look for Caitlyn and Yukio and find them near the entrance. "Hello, Caitlyn and Yukio. It's me, Dr. Kaden," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11SecretFantasy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Dr. Kaden?" Yukio asks. "You possessed Sarah Parson? The journalist? I have to wonder if you are doing this to live out some secret fantasy of yours."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioFlattersMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You complimenting my tastes flatters me, Dr. Kiyoshi," I say to Yukio, sarcastically.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ILeftMyWallet" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yukio reaches into his pocket and pulls out my wallet. "You left your wallet in my car," he says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioPullsBackWallet" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I try to take my wallet, but Yukio pulls it back. "Oh, wait. You are not Dr. Kaden. I am so sorry, Ms. Parson, for mistaking you for him," Yukio says, with ridicule.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WhatDoesYukioWant" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, Yukio, what do you want now?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WillIBookYukioARoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"If Caitlyn and I need to stay here, we need a room. Will you promise to book us one and pay for it?" Yukio asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11SarahAlreadyBooked" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sarah already booked a hotel room for herself. It has two double-sized beds. None of us have to spend any more money," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioNeedsSeparateRoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yukio shakes his head and puts his arm around Caitlyn. "No. Caitlyn and I need separate rooms. I cannot trust Caitlyn with you anymore."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukiItsFine" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yuki, it's fine," Caitlyn says, but Yukio ignores her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioGivesMeWallet" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Okay, fine," I give in. Yukio finally gives me my wallet.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WeEnterHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We head through the entrance. The Kenyon Hotel's lobby is spacious and well decorated. This hotel is a lot better than that small, no-name hotel that I was at earlier this week.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioWaitsByEscalator" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"We will be by the escalator, while you get us a room," Yukio says. I head to the reception desk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGreetReceptionist" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hi, I booked a room here earlier today," I say to the receptionist. "I was wondering if we could book a second room. I have some last-minute companions."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ReceptionistBooksRoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure," the receptionist says. She tells me the cost of the second room and asks me to pay.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11HowDoIPay" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Now, the question is: do I pay for Yukio's and Caitlyn's room with my money, or with Sarah's money?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IPayAsMyself" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I decide to pay with my own money.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGiveMyCardToReceptionist" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I take my payment card out of my wallet and give it to the receptionist. She looks at my card. "You don't look like an 'Alexander Kaden', Ms.," she says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IAmMyBoyfriend" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, he's … my boyfriend," I say to the receptionist.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ProveIt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Prove it," the receptionist says, folding her arms.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IStare" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stare blankly at her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IdentityTheft" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'm just kidding," she laughs. "We're supposed to check for those things now. You remember all of that identity theft our country had last year, right? You're fine, though." She hands back my card. "You're Sarah Parson, right? It took me a while to recognize you," she says. I nod back.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11AmICute" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"By the way, is this 'Alexander' cute?" she asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YeahIBlush" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah," I respond, blushing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IPayAsSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I decide to pay with Sarah's money.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGiveSarahsCardToReceptionist" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I hand Sarah's payment card to the receptionist. She looks at Sarah's name.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ReceptionistKnowsMeAsSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, Sarah Parson. You're from the news channel, right?" the receptionist asks, excited.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YeahINod" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah," I smile and nod.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ReceptionistIsFanOfSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, I should have recognized you right away! I'm a big fan of yours. Can I have your autograph?" the receptionist asks, handing me a notepad on the desk.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11LovelyFollower" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure thing, lovely follower," I say to her. I sign "Sarah Parson", imitating Sarah's handwriting as well as I can.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ReceptionistSwipesSarahsCard" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Thanks," says the receptionist. She swipes Sarah's card and gives it back. I feel a bit bad, though. As it is, the real Sarah won't get to experience her high school reunion, and now, she's out some money, just because Yukio's being stubborn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGetKeycard" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Here is your second key, Ms. Parson," the receptionist says, handing me a keycard.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGoToEscalator" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I go to Caitlyn and Yukio by the escalator. "Yukio, I have your keycard," I say, to get his attention.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGiveYukioKeycard" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yukio turns around. "Thank you," he says, taking his keycard. "I must apologize for my behavior. I was working stressfully all this week, and I have been taking out the stress on you. It is not right."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WhereDoWeEat" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Whatever, Yukio," I say. I look at my clock. "It's lunchtime. Where should we eat?" I ask. Caitlyn and Yukio shrug. Well, I guess that it's up to me then. Like I said before, the Kenyon Imperial Hotel has several restaurants. Each one serves its own type of cuisine, and each one has a different price range.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WeGoToHabitat" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It's probably best just to get something that will hold me over until the reunion, something affordable. "Let's go to The Habitat," I say to Caitlyn and Yukio. They agree, and we go.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IAcceptYukiosApology" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We walk through the hotel to get to The Habitat. I'm walking beside Yukio, and I see him frowning. "Hey, Yukio, I was just kidding," I say to him. "I really do accept your apology." Yukio sighs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11HostGreetsUs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We finally reach The Habitat, a rainforest-themed casual diner. "Hello, welcome to The Habitat," says an employee in a safari outfit, as we come in.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WeSitAtHabitat" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The employee seats us at a table. We look through the menu. "I might have a good-old cheeseburger," I say to Caitlyn and Yukio.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11INeedToWatchSarahsWeight" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Kadey, you might want to watch Sarah's weight," reminds Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11SarahWillBeFine" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Nah, Sarah will be fine," I wink at Caitlyn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11YukioIsLuckyToBeWithUs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The server comes by. "You must be lucky to be eating out with two fine ladies," he says to Yukio. The server takes our orders and leaves.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IEatBurger" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sometime later, we get our food. My burger is nice and juicy. It even comes with thin-cut, fried potatoes. Yum! Oh, and coleslaw.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11HabitatDims" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>In the middle of eating my food, the lights in the restaurant dim out. What's going on? Is someone cutting the power?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11FakeThunder" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Suddenly, the lights flash, accompanied by thunder on the loudspeaker.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11FakeMonkey" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The loudspeaker then plays monkey sounds, "Ooh ooh aah aah aah aah aah!"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11HabitatIsLame" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The lights finally brighten back to normal. Well, that was lame. I could barely even see my cheeseburger while that was happening.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IFinishEating" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We finish our food. We each pay for our own meals.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WeGoUpstairs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We leave the restaurant and take the elevator up to our rooms.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IEnterHotelRoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'll let you guys know when the event starts," I say to Caitlyn and Yukio. They go into their room. I look for my own keycard in my handbag.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IExamineSarahsRoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look around Sarah's hotel room. It looks nice and tidy. I see luggage by the bed. It seems that Sarah was here earlier, before I possessed her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ICheckSarahsCloset" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look in the closet. A few of Sarah's outfits are hung.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWillExcercise" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Hm … Caitlyn did ask me to watch Sarah's weight. Maybe I can make up for the cheeseburger by exercising. I know that this hotel has a workout center, so I can go there.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IChangeIntoAthleticWear" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I change out of my current clothes into a more athletic outfit.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ILookAtHotelMirror" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I end up wearing a lightweight sweatshirt, unzipped, over my undershirt. I'm also wearing athletic shorts and running shoes. I look at myself in the mirror. I look just about ready, but I feel like I'm forgetting something.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWorePonytailAsAnanya" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Oh, that's right! When I was going to physical education class as Ananya, I tied my hair into a ponytail, so that my hair wouldn't get in the way. I should do that here, too.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ITieSarahsHair" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Done. I look in the mirror one more time. Yep, I'm ready to go. I take Sarah's wallet and keycard out from her handbag and into the pocket of my sweatshirt, and then I head out.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IKnockForCaitlyn" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stop by Yukio and Caitlyn's room, and knock on the door.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11CaitlynOpensDoor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn opens the door. "Hi there," she says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WillCaitlynExcerciseWithMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hi, Caitlyn. You said that I should maintain Sarah's weight earlier, so I'm going down to the fitness center to work out. Do you want to come with me?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11CaitlynDoesNotExcerciseWithMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sorry, Kadey, but Yuki and I are busy right now. Still, it's nice of you to think about Sarah's health. You must really care about her," Caitlyn says. "Take it easy," she says, hugging me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IEnterHealthClub" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I take the elevator down to the Kenyon Imperial Hotel Health Club. I swipe my key through the card reader and head inside.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ILookForTreadmill" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>There are other people inside. I see an unused treadmill and decide to use it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IRunOnTreadmill" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I run on the treadmill, and I manage to keep a steady pace. Yeah, I'm working off those 150 grams! I can even feel Sarah's average-strength muscles building up. This feels great! Now I know why it's a good idea to exercise every week.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGetOffTreadmill" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Once I feel that I'm done, I stop the treadmill and get off.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GuestApproachesMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm about to leave, when another hotel guest approaches me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GuestFlirts" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, hey … I saw you running on the treadmill. You really seemed to be going at it. That kind of athleticism shouldn't go to waste."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11AmIGoodOrBad" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The man walks towards me and backs me into a wall. "I have a question. Are you a good girl, or are you a bad girl?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GuestWastesMyTime" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ugh, this man is wasting my time. Should I play along anyway, or just leave him?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ILeaveGuest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I decide to leave him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IAmGoodGirl" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'm a good girl today. Sorry to disappoint you, creeper," I tell him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IPushGuest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I extend my tentacles from my back and push him away.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GuestWillNotForget" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The man falls to the floor. "I won't forget this!" he tells me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IPlayGuest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I decide to play along.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IAmNaughtyFemale" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, yes, I am a naughty female," I say, smirking at him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GladToHearIt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Glad to hear it," he replies.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWrapGuest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"In fact, I'm so naughty, I can do this …" I tell him, and I extend my tentacles from my back. I wrap my tentacles around him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11WhatIsMyProblem" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Agh!" the man shouts. "What's your problem, Lady?" He pushes himself out of my tentacles and falls onto the floor.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11GuestAskedForIt" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You asked for it," I say coldly.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ILeaveHealthClub" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Other people in the fitness center stare at us, confused. I walk out and head back to my room.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IRelax" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I sit on my bed and relax. It's midafternoon, and there's plenty of time to spare before the reunion late tonight. I'm tired from working out, so I should stay here.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWillShower" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I decide to take a shower.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IShouldCool" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I worked up quite a sweat, so it's reasonable that I cool off by showering.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ILayNewClothes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I lay out some clean, new clothing on the bed, so that I have something to change into after I'm done.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IGetTowel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I pick out a towel, bring it into the bathroom, and lay it just outside the shower.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IAdjustTemperature" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn on the shower and adjust the temperature. Once the temperature is just right, I undress and walk in.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IShower" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Ah, these past few days have been hectic. A good shower helps me put everything back in focus. It's just me, alone with the running water. It's quiet and relaxing.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IFeelGood" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Heheh, who am I kidding? I feel goooooooood.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IDry" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After my shower, I dry myself off with the towel. I walk out to the bedroom.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWatchTV" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I decide to watch television.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11NewNewsSegment" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn on the television set in my room. It has the news channel. I watch a news segment done by another reporter.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11SeawallIntroduced" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The reporter is standing outside. "I'm out on the coastline of New Ferando. Right now, we are standing on top of New Ferando's seawall, which keeps the Western Ocean separated from the city."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11CameraShowsSeawall" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The camera moves to the edge of the seawall and points downwards.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11MayorIsCriticized" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"As you can see, the wall is in moderate disrepair. The mayor of New Ferando is being criticized for neglecting the safety of his citizens."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11Potholes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The video fades to prerecorded footage of cars driving on the road. "The seawall is not the only safety concern for which the mayor has been criticized. New Ferando's busier roads, as well as its highway, have been reported to contain potholes," says a voiceover of the reporter.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11MayorsDefense" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The footage then shows the mayor of New Ferando being interviewed outside the city hall. "We make the most out of our budget," he says. "We spend a fortune on education. We spend a fortune on healthcare and our hospitals. Ultimately, it is up to our prime minister in the mainland to give us an adequate budget to take care of these problems, and, in recent years, he has simply been unable to do so."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11ITurnOffTV" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Eh, it's just politics. I turn off the television shortly afterwards.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch11IWearFormalwear" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I put on the formalwear that Sarah was going to wear to the reunion. Now that that is out of the way, I can take a nap and be ready to go to the reunion as soon as I wake up. I lie on top of my bed and go to sleep.</value>

    <value>10 years ago …</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12RebeccaAvoidedMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rebecca hadn't been meeting up with me for lunch at school as often as she used to. At first, I didn't think much about it. I just ate alone and then worked on my homework for the rest of the lunch period. A few weeks passed, and, well, I got curious about what was going on with Rebecca.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12ISpiedOnRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>One weekend, I took my binoculars and entered the building across the street from our apartment building. I went up to the roof.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12ISawIntoRebeccaRoom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>From there, I looked into Rebecca's room. It was dim, but from what I was able to make out, Rebecca was sitting on her bed with another person, and they were looking into each other's eyes. Then, the other person reached towards Rebecca, and …</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12DidRebeccaLoseInterest" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>… And … well … I just felt too nervous. I lowered my binoculars, and I was a bit confused. I understood that Rebecca enjoyed being with her other friends, but … why this? What was wrong with me that had Rebecca lose interest?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12MyHeartStopped" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Just that moment, my heart felt like it stopped. I had just realized what was going on, but I had to make sure.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12ICaughtRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The following week, I met up with Rebecca at school. "Rebecca! I … we … we haven't really talked to each other these past few weeks. I mean … I'm sure you're okay, but … uh …" I started to nervously stutter.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12RebeccaWasUncomfortable" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At first, Rebecca looked puzzled, but then she looked down and sighed. "Alex … you've been giving me a lot of attention lately. I just needed some space. Look, I …" She swore under her breath. "… We've been good friends and everything, but … you've just been a bit too controlling. I mean, I get it. You're the socially-awkward geek, and you probably mean well by all of this, but … I just don't think I'm the right girl for you. If you could be in my shoes, you'd understand."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch12ILeftRebeccaAlone" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I looked down for a moment too, staring blankly at the ground. "And Alex …" I look back up. "… please, for the rest of the school year, let me be by myself. Thanks," she said softly. I nodded and walked away.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13Title" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Chapter 13</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IAwaken" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I wake up from my nap. I'm still alone in my room. I look at the clock. I have about half an hour before the reunion starts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IPace" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I get up and pace around my room. Hm, what else can I do to prepare for the reunion? Well, if I stay as Sarah, maybe I should access some more of her memories. It might help me stay in character during the event.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IConcentrate" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I start to concentrate. Ergh! It's making my head hurt. I need to stop thinking.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IClearMyMind" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stop, clear my mind, and take some deep breaths. I start to feel better.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13RebeccaAppears" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn around and see Rebecca sitting on my bed. "I'm glad we met," she says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IsRebeccaVaNal" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"How did you get in here? Are you Va'Nal again?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13RebeccaHasNoPlaceForMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Rebecca ignores what I said. "I remember when I first met him. I was young then. I thought I could open up to him. For all of those years, he acted like a friend, but I was wrong about him. He didn't actually care," Rebecca sniffles. She looks up at me, "Then, I met you. You reminded me what true friendship was. You let me realize that he had no place in my life. You let me realize that I didn't really need a boyfriend."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13StopItRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Rebecca, come on. Don't talk like that," I say nervously.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13RebeccaVanishes" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I walk towards her and reach out, but she vanishes. Oh, what's going on?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IWashMyFace" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I go to the bathroom sink and splash water on my face. I look at Sarah's reflection again. I feel a little bit better.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IGetCaitlynAndYukio" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I leave my room and go to the door of Yukio and Caitlyn's room. I knock. They answer, and I tell them that I'm ready to go.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13WeWalkToBallroom" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We walk through the halls of the hotel on our way to the ballroom. This is it! It's been years since I've seen Rebecca! What am I going to say to her? What would Sarah say to her?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IFeelLightheaded" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I start to feel lightheaded.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13ILeanOnWall" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I tell Caitlyn and Yukio that I need to stop and lean on the wall for a moment. I take more deep breaths.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13AnxietyAttack" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Tentacles come out of my back. Now what's happening? Am I losing control of my powers? It must be the anxiety. Why am I so worried? Rebecca won't see me anyway, when I talk to her. She'll see Sarah.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IAmAMonster" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look at my tentacles again. Ah, who am I kidding? She won't see Sarah either. She'll see a monster.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IShouldNotGo" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn stares silently in shock at me. Yukio asks, "Kaden, what is going on? You look unwell. Perhaps you should not go to this event, until you have calmed down."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IHaveToGo" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I have to go!" I shout.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13YukioIsRight" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I have a lot going through my head right now. Still, Yukio has a point. "You're right, Yukio," I say. "I just need a moment to calm down. Stay here. I'll be back in a couple of minutes."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IGoToBalcony" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I walk to a nearby balcony outside. I see the view of the city in front of me. It's still raining. The sky is grey, like it always is this time of year.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13AmIUpset" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Are you upset?" a voice asks behind me. I turn around.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IWasNeverTheProblem" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"We got off on the wrong foot, didn't we?" remarks Baqer. "I was getting all mad at you, and for what? It turns out you weren't the problem in the first place."</value>

  <data name="ch13RebeccaMadeMeBad" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"That Rebecca girl. What happened with her? For nearly six years, you treated her right. You were there for her, weren't you? Those years go by. You're near the end of high school. You wait for her to repay you, but what does she do? She doubts. She changes her mind. She backs out. And what's the worst part? She makes you the bad guy."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13TooLateForRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Baqer looks out to the city. "Go to the reunion, if you want. Let's be honest, though. Even if the girl is there, what's the point? Even if she apologizes, what's the point? It's too late for that. She wasn't there when you needed her the most. Getting through to her is a lost cause," Baqer says, shaking his head.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13RebeccaWasNotThere" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You're right. She wasn't there," I admit.</value>

    <value>"Don't listen to him, Best Friend," Sezja says to me. "Think about the powers our brother Bek'Shtii has given you. You can be with anyone you want. You can be anyone you want."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13ILookWonderful" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sezja looks me over. "Oh, you look wonderful! Stop doubting yourself, Friend. Go to that reunion and be the person she wants you to be."</value>

  <data name="ch13IEncounterOfficer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I head back to where Caitlyn and Yukio were. When I reach them, I see a police officer standing beside them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13PoliceReceivedComplaint" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Hello, Sarah Parson. We were looking for you. One of the hotel guests complained that a woman with tentacles attacked him."</value>

    <value>"Oh, really?" I ask sarcastically.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13DidIDealWithScientists" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Miss Parson, I do believe that you interviewed a park ranger about a man who shapeshifted into a dark figure with glowing red eyes. And, the day before, you interviewed another police officer about that same dark figure with red eyes. I always thought you were the deceptive type, Miss Parson. Tell me, what do you know about this dark phantom? Did you make a deal with those mad scientists up in the mountains?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13HotScoop" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The officer turns to Caitlyn and Yukio and looks back at me. "Ah, that would explain it," he says. "Maybe you are the phantom who attacked my coworker earlier this week. Why did you do it, Young Lady? Did you want even more fame? Was being a successful journalist not good enough for you? I bet you wanted a big story that would push you to the top! You wanted a hit so bad, you went to these mad scientists to make you one of these phantom-things so that you would be the talk of the town, so that you would be your own hot scoop."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13HotScoopInJail" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Well, let me make it clear, Miss Parson, you'll get your hot scoop … in jail!"</value>
  </data>

    <value>The officer raises an electroshock pistol at me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13ICounterOfficer" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I extend my tentacles and push his arm up just as he's about to electrocute me. "Okay, one, I'm not really Sarah Parson. Two, you should watch your attitude, Officer," I taunt him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13OfficerSummonsAgent" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, you're not getting away, whoever you are. Agent, get this thing!" the officer shouts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13IAmVacuumed" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A man with a vacuum device on his back enters the hall. He nods at the officer, and the man points the hose of the device at me. I get separated from Sarah's body, and I get sucked into the device. "I knew that our country's Bureau of Paranormal Investigations would be useful," the officer chuckles.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13ItIsDark" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>It's so dark in here. I can't see anything. I hear the officer's voice. "Ma'am, you need to stay put! This is official business."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13TheyTakeMeAway" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Kadey, don't let them take you away!" says Caitlyn's voice.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="ch13KatieIsEmbarrassing" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Katie? Your name is 'Katie'? That's embarrassing for a menace like yourself! No wonder why you don't want us to know," the officer laughs.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch13KatieFoolsThem" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Uh, yeah, that's right. My name is 'Katie'. Darn, well, I guess you got me now," I tell the officer.</value>

  <data name="ch15IAmInJail" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I awaken in my gaseous form. I'm in a glass tube, about the size of a person. Just outside the tube are the confines of a jail cell.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ISeeViolinist" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I hear somber music. I turn around and see a prisoner in another cell playing a violin. He looks down at the ground while playing, deprived of any hope.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ISeeBeggar" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I turn around again and see another prisoner shaking a can of coins. "Spare change, Sir?" the prisoner asks, looking up at a passing jailer.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ISeeAddict" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look at one final prisoner, who's in a cell right next to me. He's breathing from a large inhaling device.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15AddictTalks" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He notices me and turns his head. "Hey Man, didn't notice you until now. Wow, I've seen some pretty gnarly stuff before, but you're the real deal, aren't you? What are you anyway, and what did you get busted for?"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15SoundproofTube" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I can't respond to him. My tube must be soundproof.</value>

  <data name="ch15IHaveCivilRights" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Shortly afterwards, the prisoners fall asleep. I look up at the small window in my cell. It's overcast and raining. It doesn't matter, though. I can't do anything in this tube. The police department doesn't think that they can keep me in this tube, do they? I have civil rights!</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15BallBreaksMyCell" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>A wrecking ball crashes through the back wall of my cell and breaks my tube. I fly out of the broken tube and reform into my physical body.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ConstructorGreetsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Outside, I see a construction worker inside the cabin of a crane. The worker steps out of the cabin and waves his arms. "Hey, Best Friend, I set you free!"</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ConstructorIsDispossessed" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Suddenly, a figure jumps out from the construction worker's body. The figure lands in front of the worker.</value>

    <value>The roads nearby are all flooded.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15BekShtiiAndBaqerFight" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"While you were in jail, my two brothers started fighting," Sezja explains. "All this time, we have been wanting you to bring the change that our continent sorely needs. When you got captured, my brothers decided to take matters into their own hands and bring that change themselves. Bek'Shtii has changed into a large phantom and has flooded half of the city, hoping to erase the existing life and to begin anew. Baqer, on the other hand, just wants to destroy everything. Baqer split himself into hundreds of fire spirits and is terrorizing the other half of the city."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15CanBaqerTurnIntoFireSpirits" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Wait, hold on. Baqer turned himself into hundreds of fire spirits? I … didn't know that he could do that," I tell Sezja.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15DoIDislikeHistory" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I guess you're not into history, are you?" Sezja laughs. "Maybe when we were those students, I should've been someone who had history class with you. Then, I could have helped you learn all the good stuff," he adds.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15DidSezjaEnjoySchool" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"You really enjoyed being at that school, didn't you?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ThereIsCamp" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yup," he says, rubbing the back of his head. He sighs, "I guess this isn't a good time to be cheerful. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk." Sezja frowns. "Listen, there's an evacuation camp at the airport, at the top of the New Ferando Hill. Find your friends and take them to the camp. I'm sure the government will fly you out of this place. I don't know if I'll ever see you again."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15SezjaHugs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sezja hugs me. "This is it, Good Buddy," he says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15SezjaPaddles" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sezja walks away to the flooded roads. He takes off his mask and sets it on the water. He sits on the mask, like a raft, and paddles away.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15MeAndCity" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>So this is it, then. It's me and the city. I watch as the flood rises and some of the weaker buildings begin to crumble. I need to act now.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ILookAtConstructor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look at the construction worker that Sezja had possessed just moments ago.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IPossessConstructor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>He might be useful, so I possess him.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15MyTeethAreBad" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Yuck! My mouth feels odd. My teeth feel like they're rotting, and at least one tooth must be missing altogether. Oh well. Dental hygiene isn't important when I need to save the world.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IClimbBuilding" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I extend my tentacles and climb up a nearby tall building.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ISeeRestOfCity" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>At the top, I get a better view of the city. Wow, Sezja was right. The flood really does cover half the city, and I can see some buildings far away, on the other side of the city, on fire. Fortunately, the rain does seem to keep the fire contained, but the fire is still there. It's not like the rain is going to stop the flood, either.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IFindConstructionSite" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I need a weapon. I look around and find a construction site, which seems to have been recently abandoned.</value>

  <data name="ch15IJumpToConstructionSite" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I jump down to it, using my tentacles to cushion my landing.</value>

    <value>I climb up another building and start leaping from rooftop to rooftop.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15PeopleBelowTrapped" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I occasionally look down at the streets below. There are still plenty of people left in the city, who haven't evacuated. Most of them are trapped on a small patch of land, with the rest of the ground around them submerged in water.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IFindFireSpirits" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I keep going, and I eventually see a group of fire spirits down below causing mischief. I jump down and confront them.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15SpiritsSurroundMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The fire spirits take notice and surround me. They grin and rub their hands together.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ISlamSpirits" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I clench my pickaxe. The spirits step towards me. I grab them with my tentacles and slam them to the ground.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IDeathByOverconfidence" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stand over one of them. "Don't overestimate yourself, Baqer! Remember, two out of five deaths are due to over-confidence," I say, spitting through my missing tooth. The fire spirit gasps.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15KeptYouWaiting" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stand over one of them. "I kept you waiting, huh, Baqer," I say, spitting through my missing tooth. The fire spirit gasps.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IStrikeSpirit" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I strike my pickaxe down on the spirit. The fire spirit crumbles into a pile of hot ash. I make quick work of the other fire spirits, as well.</value>

  </data>
  <data name="ch15SchoolBusNeedsHelp" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch15IDispossessConstructor" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I land near the school bus and dispossess the construction worker. "I'm here! I'll help you!" I shout.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IAmHero" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The students on the bus turn around and cheer. "Hey, isn't that the phantom guy on TV?" one student asks. "Maybe. He sure is a hero!" says another student.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ILiftBus" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I use my tentacles to lift the bus out of the water and onto dry road.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15StudentsThankMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The students and the bus driver come out through the emergency back door. "Thanks, Mr. Phantom!" the students say. Among them are Élodie, Carleigh, and Hewitt. "Hey, you look familiar. You're Élodie, aren't you?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IKnowElodie" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch15KeepFriendsClose" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch15ICanSayEllie" xml:space="preserve">

  </data>
  <data name="ch15PhantomGoesToHotel" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Not too far away, I see a large, black, ghostly figure walking towards the Kenyon Imperial Hotel.</value>
  </data>

    <value>Is that Bek'Shtii?</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15WhatIsBekShtiiDoing" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I fly over to the large figure. "Bek'Shtii! Bek'Shtii! Is that you? What are you doing?" I ask.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15ModernSelfishness" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The ghostly figure turns around, his eyes glowing a bright yellow. "Do not interfere, Dr. Kaden," says Bek'Shtii. "Five hundred years ago, I had lost my loyal, loving followers. In the wake of their passing, I have since watched over this continent. I have seen the changes through which the western continent underwent. It is clear now what has become of modern society. You are a selfish, despicable lot. Undisciplined, uncaring, unfaithful. The past was a better time, and I will gladly recreate its glory, if I must."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IHoldBekShtiiBack" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, well, that doesn't help me," I tell Bek'Shtii. I reach out for Bek'Shtii with my tentacles and try to hold him back from reaching the hotel.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15BekShtiiThrowsMe" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Bek'Shtii picks me up and throws me several city blocks away. I hit the wall of a building hard and fall into the floodwater below.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IDrift" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I'm dizzy and weak. I look up at the grey sky. The flow of the water is carrying me away. Away from Bek'Shtii. Away from the hotel.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IShouldHaveBeenAtReunion" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>This wasn't supposed to happen. I should have been at the reunion. I could have seen all of those familiar faces. I could have socialized and have had fun, but no. No, now the city of New Ferando is flooded. Now there are people who need to be rescued. And now, I'm too weak to even help anymore.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch15IWillBeRescued" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Everything around me gets quieter. Maybe, in a little while, I'll wash up on dry land. The government will find me and rescue me, and who knows what they'll do next. All I know is that, for now, this phantom has done all that he can. I close my eyes and let myself drift away.</value>

  <data name="ch18pNextChapter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"We are powerful entities, capable of controlling weaker beings," I continue. "It is clear, then, that we phantoms are the next chapter in our world's history."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18pInfiltrateSociety" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"That is why I am pleased to announce that, over the course of the next several years, we will infiltrate the societies of the outside world."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18pYeah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah!" the audience shouts.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18pWeWillRule" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I nod in glee. "The people of the southern continent will be under phantom rule, as will the people of the southeastern continent, and the eastern continent, and the northern continent. And last, but far from least, the mainland itself will be ours."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18pApplause" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The crowd applauds.</value>

  <data name="ch18csTimeLater" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>6 months later …</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cRaylenPark" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn and I are walking Foxtrot around Raylen Central Park, in the mainland. The day is clear and sunny.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cFoxtrotStoppedHiss" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>While he had hissed at me earlier, Foxtrot has since gotten used to me having Bek'Shtii's blood.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cCaitlynWantsStrawberry" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We come across a man with an ice cream cart. "Ohh, let's get ice cream! I want strawberry," Caitlyn says.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cIWantVanilla" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Sure, uh … I'll get vanilla," I tell her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cWeBuyIceCream" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We go up to the vendor and buy our ice cream. "Right. Strawberry for the fine young lady, and vanilla for the gent. Here you go," the vendor says, handing our ice cream.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cWeEat" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yum! Thanks for taking Foxy and me out," Caitlyn says, eating her ice cream. Foxtrot perks up at her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18csWeGoToFlat" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>After our outing, we drive to our new flat.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cWeCuddle" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The afternoon passes. At night, I light our fireplace. Caitlyn and I cuddle on the couch in front of it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cIExaminePhoto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn lays her head on me and closes her eyes. I reach into my pocket and take out an old photograph of Rebecca and me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cCaitlynSeesPhoto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn opens her eyes. "Who's that?" she asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cFormerAngst" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"A former source of angst," I tell her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cWeLookedCute" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"How come?" Caitlyn looks up at me. "You two look cute together."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18cThingsDoNotWorkOut" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Thanks. I thought so, too, but sometimes, things don't work out," I shrug.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18csIBurnPhoto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I toss the photograph into the fireplace, and I watch it burn.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sSupermarket" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah and I are grocery shopping at a supermarket in Raylen, a suburban city in the mainland. Sarah finishes by buying some low-fat yoghurt for herself. "Thanks for coming out with me," Sarah smiles.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sWeBuyGroceries" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We go to the checkout lane and pay for our groceries. "I recognise you two from before," remarks the grocer. "What have you been doing?" he asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sWeMightStay" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Oh, I was a news reporter on the western continent, for KNFN News. I'm looking for a new position in journalism here." Sarah glances at me and smiles. "I think that we might stay here."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sAlwaysAPleasure" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Right then, always a pleasure to see westerners such as yourselves," smiles the grocer. "Have a nice day."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sWeCuddle" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>The afternoon passes. At night, I light our fireplace. Sarah and I cuddle on the couch in front of it.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sSarahKnowsMeBetter" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"I'm glad that I've gotten to know you better," says Sarah.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sSoAmI" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"So am I," I say.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sWeKiss" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>We kiss.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sIExaminePhoto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah lays her head on me and closes her eyes. I reach into my pocket and take out an old photograph of Rebecca and me.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sSarahSeesPhoto" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah opens her eyes. "Is that you and Rebecca?" she asks.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sYeahItIs" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"Yeah, it is," I tell her.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sWeLookedCute" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah looks up at me. "I didn't realize how cute the two of you were together. I'm sorry that things didn't work out."</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18sINuzzleSarah" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>"It's okay. You and I are together now," I say, nuzzling her.</value>

  <data name="ch18vTimeLater" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>1 year later …</value>

  <data name="ch18vGoddessOfPride" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I am Va'Nal-Kaden, the goddess of pride.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vContinentIsWell" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I look over the western continent, to make sure that all is well with its inhabitants.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vCaitlynAndYukioResearch" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Caitlyn Rylie and Yukio Kiyoshi, who originally evacuated to the mainland, have since returned to the Arcticon Research Facility. They continue to do research, as usual.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vCaitlynAndYukioTogether" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>They also seem to be quite happy with each other.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vSarahReports" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Sarah Parson has also returned from her initial evacuation. She has earned much respect as a news reporter for KNFN. The public has since forgotten the "Phantom of the West", so Sarah now continuously looks for the next big story.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vElodieCarleighAndHewittStudy" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Élodie, Carleigh, and Hewitt are now in ninth grade. They're all doing well in school.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vCarleighHonors" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>Carleigh is even an honors student now! She can thank me for that.</value>
  </data>
  <data name="ch18vICannotSeeRebecca" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I don't know how well Rebecca is doing. I presume that she's in the mainland. My powers are limited to this continent, so I can't watch over her if she's not here. It may as well be for the better, though.</value>

  <data name="ch18vSunSets" xml:space="preserve">
    <value>I stand by my brothers at the top of our pyramid. The sun sets behind us. Another day ends.</value>
