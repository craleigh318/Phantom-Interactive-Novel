It reminds me of how much work it took to make this. I finish the elixir, but there\'s some time left before it\'ll take effect.";

ch1ILeaveHotel = "I leave my hotel room and walk out to the city below. There are plenty of people walking by the streets, but it\'s not that loud.

ch1ILookAtMyHands = "My hand, my skin, my clothes, they\'re all different. The elixir must have worked.";

ch1IGoToOfficersHome = "I need to rest and think about what I\'ll do. I find the officer\'s car nearby and drive to his home. I didn\'t really need to think about where this officer lived. It just came naturally to me.";

Also, I need to give birth to an actual baby to produce milk anyway. I\'m a doctor, so I should have known that. Oops.\" Caitlyn is right.

For example, you lied to our supervisor about the compound that you were working on actually was. Then, you managed to convince him to have Caitlyn and I help you with it. This morning, you asked Caitlyn to drive you back here. She is not your chauffeur. She is your coworker, as am I. You are not our boss. You, Caitlyn, and I are equal in rank.
