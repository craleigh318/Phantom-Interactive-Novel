    <string name="ch1Title">Chapter 1</string>
    <string name="ch1IAmDrKaden">My name is Dr. Alexander Kaden. If you can hear me, or at least, read what I\'m saying, then you\'ve come at a good time. This evening, I\'m going to drink an elixir that allows me to possess other people.</string>
    <string name="ch1ThisIsNewFerando">That\'s the city of New Ferando out there. It\'s the main port of the western continent. I have lived on this continent since I was young. The people here will be the first to see my making of history. This rainy evening, everything changes.</string>
    <string name="ch1IDrinkElixir">There is no point in wasting time. I drink the elixir. As I do, I smell the mixture of blood. It was a special kind of blood, and an essential ingredient. It reminds me of how much work it took to make this. I finish the elixir, but there\'s some time left before it\'ll take effect.</string>
    <string name="ch1ILeaveHotel">I leave my hotel room and walk out to the city below. There are plenty of people walking by the streets, but it\'s not that loud. I\'m a bit excited, and I don\'t feel that a lot nowadays. Once this elixir takes effect, there are a lot of things I can do, and these people around me have no idea what\'s about to happen.</string>
    <string name="ch1IGoToAlley">It\'s been some time now, and I don\'t feel well. My mind is spacing out, and I might be getting weaker. I turn into a nearby alley and fall to my knees.</string>
    <string name="ch1OfficerSeesMe">A patrolling police officer notices me and stops in the alley. \"Are you all right, Sir?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch1MyFaceDisappears">I\'m still lightheaded, but I manage to tilt my head up to look at the officer. I cannot feel my own face though. Is it missing?</string>
    <string name="ch1IOpenMyEyes">Just a moment later, I can open my eyes. This has to be it. I\'m as light as vapor now. This is a good opportunity to test my new ability.</string>
    <string name="ch1IPossessOfficer">Without hesitation, I leap towards the officer. My body is now a black, gaseous mass, and I can feel myself flying. My old pile of clothes is left behind as I absorb myself into the officer.</string>
    <string name="ch1ILookAtMyHands">My hands, my skin, my clothes, they\'re all different. The elixir must have worked.</string>
    <string name="ch1IGoToOfficersHome">I need to rest and think about what I\'ll do. I find the officer\'s car nearby and drive to his home. I didn\'t really need to think about where this officer lived. It just came naturally to me.</string>
    <string name="ch1ISleep">I go up into the officer\'s apartment. The bedroom inside is all right. I lie on the bed and nap.</string>
    <string name="ch2Title">Chapter 2</string>
    <string name="ch2TimeAgo">8 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch2ThereWereFourGods">I was attending L\'Université de Éclair in the mainland, and was in Prof. Arvin\'s world history lecture at the time. \"Six hundred years ago, the natives of the western continent lived in peace,\" he said. \"Those natives worshiped four gods.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2ThereWasSezja">\"Sezja was the god of play. Behind his wooden mask was a joyful man with long, flowing hair.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2ThereWasBaqer">\"Baqer was the god of indulgence. He was the chief of the gods, and he basked himself in his own power.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2ThereWasVaNal">\"Va\'Nal was the goddess of romance. Few could resist her beautiful, leafy, green hair.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2ThereWasBekShtii">\"Finally, Bek\'Shtii was the god of tradition and the past. While he was not the leader, Bek\'Shtii was perhaps the smartest of the group.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2LectureEnded">I relaxed for the rest of the lecture. \"That is all for today,\" the professor concluded. \"I have my normal office hours, if anyone needs them.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2IWentToProfArvin">After class, I walked to Prof. Arvin\'s office to see him.</string>
    <string name="ch2IGreetProf">\"Hello, Professor,\" I said.</string>
    <string name="ch2ProfGreetsMe">\"Hello, Kaden, what do you need?\"</string>
    <string name="ch2IConfideToProf">\"Well, I\'ve been studying for your class, but I\'ve been having a lot on my mind. I\'ve been thinking about other things. I\'m not sure what the best thing to do is.\"</string>
    <string name="ch2ProfDismissesMe">\"Kaden, I am just a professor. I am not a counselor. I am not sure about what you can do. However, whatever the problem is, I hope that you can take care of it so that you can do well here. Take care, Kaden.\" The professor and I shook hands, and I left.</string>
    <string name="ch3Title">Chapter 3</string>
    <string name="ch3IAwaken">I wake up, feeling refreshed. I had a feeling that waking up in a different body would be awkward, but I\'m actually adjusting fairly well.</string>
    <string name="ch3SezjaGreetsMe">\"Good morning, Sleepy Head!\"</string>
    <string name="ch3SezjaStartlesMe">\"Waah! Who are you?\" I ask the man lying next to me, on the bed. He\'s wearing a robe and a wooden tribal mask, the same mask that the natives of the west wore. I assume that he\'s Sezja, one of the native gods. I don\'t see how any other person could have gotten into this room, especially dressed like that.</string>
    <string name="ch3SezjaAnswers">\"My brother said that he sensed someone drinking his blood, so I just came by to see who it was. Now that that mystery\'s solved, I guess I can leave you alone, for now. Oh, and I\'ll see if I can get the rest of the family to meet you. Ta ta!\" Sezja says, and slides off the edge of the bed.</string>
    <string name="ch3SezjaLeaves">I lean over the edge to see him, but he\'s gone.</string>
    <string name="ch3IHaveToSignOut">Well, it seems like I\'m almost ready to start my body-hopping adventure in earnest, but I have three more things to worry about. First, I have to sign out of my hotel room, since I don\'t want to pay for any more nights. I deliberately left the key in the room, so I\'ll fly through the crack in either the door or the window to get it.</string>
    <string name="ch3PoliceWillBeSuspicious">Second, the police department might be getting suspicious that I, as this police officer, haven\'t reported over the night.</string>
    <string name="ch3IHaveToReturnToArcticon">Third, I live at the Arcticon Research Facility, a large underground science complex located in the snowy mountains north on this continent. However, Arcticon\'s entrance is restricted to authorized personnel, and I won\'t be recognized as this officer, so I need another way to get in and out of there.</string>
    <string name="ch3MyWorkIsCutOut">Well, I have my work cut out for me.</string>
    <string name="ch3ICallCaitlyn">I use the phone in the officer\'s apartment to call a good coworker of mine, Dr. Caitlyn Rylie. \"Hello Caitlyn, I\'m Dr. Kaden,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynDoesNotRecognizeMe">\"Dr. Kaden? You sound different,\" says Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3ITellCaitlynIDrankElixir">\"Do you remember the chemical compound that we were all working on? Well, I finally drank a sample of it, and now I can possess other people.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynBelievesMe">\"Oh, Kadey, it really is you. So, you\'re in a different body then?\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IAskCaitlynToCome">\"Yeah, that\'s right, Caitlyn. Anyway, I can\'t get back to Arcticon the way I am now. Can you pick me and drive us back?\" After giving Caitlyn my street address, she agrees. \"Also, we need to stop off at the hotel that I was staying at. Is that okay, Caitlyn?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynAgreesToCome">\"Uh, okay, Kaden,\" she says.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynComes">Nearly an hour later, Caitlyn pulls in front of the apartment building. \"Caitlyn, over here!\" I wave.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynNoticesMeAsOfficer">\"Oh, hey, you really did switch bodies. And you\'re a cop? Well, all right, get in.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IAskToPossessCaitlyn">\"Actually, I need to leave this body here. I don\'t want the police department to trace any place past this officer\'s home. That means I need to possess you, Caitlyn.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynHesitatesPossession">\"Me?\" Caitlyn asks. \"Do you have to? I mean, it just seems invasive. That\'s all.\" She scratches her head.</string>
    <string name="ch3IJustifyPossession">\"Well, if I\'m not in a body, I can be in a gaseous form, but then we couldn\'t keep a low profile.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynAsksMeToDisguiseAsInfant">Caitlyn looks at a towel in the back seat. \"Wait,\" she says. \"I can wrap you in my towel, and it\'ll look like you\'re a baby in a blanket. It\'d be cute! Well, how about it?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3IDiguiseAsInfant">\"Okay Caitlyn, you can wrap me in the towel if you want to.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynBringsMeToHotel">I fly out of the officer and onto the towel. \"Thanks, Kadey,\" Caitlyn says, as she wraps me in. She drives to the hotel and goes up to my floor.</string>
    <string name="ch3IEnterHotelRoomFromBlanket">Caitlyn puts me down, in front of my door. I fly through the bottom of the door, get the key, give the keys to Caitlyn, and fly back into my blanket.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynChecksOut">Caitlyn and I go down to the lobby. While Caitlyn is checking out with the receptionist, the receptionist notices me. \"Oh, what a cute baby. Can I see?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynTriesToShowReceptionistMe">Caitlyn tries to turn me towards the receptionist, but I resist. Can Caitlyn not realize how showing my face could blow our cover? \"What\'s wrong, Kadey? Why don\'t you want to look away from my chest? Did you want to drink?\" Caitlyn asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3ReceptionistLikesKatie">\"Oh, her name\'s Katie? That\'s such a good name!\" says the receptionist. I roll my eyes.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynLeavesHotel">\"Well, we have to go,\" says Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynCannotBreastFeed">Once we\'re back in the car, Caitlyn comes to a realization. \"Wait, I can\'t breast-feed you anyway. You don\'t have a mouth. Also, I need to give birth to an actual baby to produce milk anyway. I\'m a doctor, so I should have known that. Oops.\" Caitlyn is right. I don\'t have a mouth in this form, although I might still be able to talk without it. I\'m about to call her out for her absent-mindedness, but I decide against it, since she is a good friend.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynDrivesOnHighway">Caitlyn drives north on the highway to Arcticon.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynEntersArcticon">We reach the snowy mountain pass, one of the highest points on this continent, and one that gives a great view. We pass through Arcticon\'s security checkpoint without incident. Caitlyn parks in the parking garage, and we take the adjoining tram, which goes to the underground research center.</string>
    <string name="ch3ILeaveBlanket">Afterwards, I fly out of the baby blanket.</string>
    <string name="ch3IRefuseToDiguiseAsInfant">\"No, Caitlyn. No one will think that I\'m a baby if they actually see my face.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IWillOweCaitlynAFavor">\"Okay, but you owe me if I ever need a favor later on,\" says Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3IGoToHotel">\"Understood.\" I fly out of the officer and into Caitlyn. I drive to the hotel and go up to my floor.</string>
    <string name="ch3IEnterHotelRoomFromCaitlyn">I kneel in front of my door and fly out of Caitlyn, fly through the bottom of the door, get the key, and fly back into Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3ICheckOut">I go down to the lobby and check out with the receptionist. \"You don\'t look like a \'Mr. Kaden\',\" says the receptionist, skeptically.</string>
    <string name="ch3IClaimToBeMyWife">\"I\'m his wife. I\'m just checking out for him,\" I reply.</string>
    <string name="ch3ReceptionistDoubtsMe">\"How can I be sure about that?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3IInsultReceptionist">\"Because I know more about his tastes than you do, Plain Jane,\" I smirk, tossing my key onto her desk and leaving.</string>
    <string name="ch3IDriveOnHighway">I drive north on the highway to Arcticon.</string>
    <string name="ch3IEnterArcticon">I reach the snowy mountain pass, one of the highest points on this continent, and one that gives a great view. I pass through Arcticon\'s security checkpoint without incident. I park in the parking garage and take the adjoining tram, which goes to the underground research center.</string>
    <string name="ch3IDispossessCaitlyn">Afterwards, I fly out of Caitlyn. She\'s initially dazed, but she gets better after a moment.</string>
    <string name="ch3IConjureClothes">After that, I manage to have my clothes appear on me, just by thinking about it.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynDragsMyHand">\"Come on, we need to meet Yuki,\" Caitlyn says, dragging me by the hand.</string>
    <string name="ch3YukioGreetsMe">Caitlyn leads me to a lounge with Dr. Yukio Kiyoshi, another coworker of ours. \"Hello, Caitlyn … and Kaden?\" he says, surprised.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynExplainsMyGhostliness">\"Yuki, you know how I said Kaden called me a couple of hours ago? Well, this is what he\'s like now. He can go inside other people and control them, like a ghost.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3YukioIsAwed">\"Amazing,\" Yukio says. \"So, what do we do now?\" asks Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynWantsToHelp">\"Uh …\" Caitlyn hesitates, turning towards me. \"What do you want to do, Kadey? Whatever it is, I\'m sure Yuki and I would love to help you with it.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3ILeaveCaitlynAndYukio">\"I haven\'t decided yet,\" I tell Caitlyn and Yukio. \"Okay Kaden, Caitlyn and I will be around here if you want to talk to us later,\" says Yukio. I nod and leave.</string>
    <string name="ch3IGoHome">I take the tram to the housing sector of the Arcticon Research Facility.</string>
    <string name="ch3IRelax">Once I\'m back at my apartment, I lie on my bed, relaxed.</string>
    <string name="ch3BekShtiiGreetsMe">\"Hello. I am pleased to meet you, Dr. Kaden,\" says a voice. I turn to a man standing near my bedroom door. He\'s wearing a leather waistcoat, a tribal skirt made of cloth, and leather boots. \"I am Bek\'Shtii, god of tradition and the past. Surely, you already know about me.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IKnowBekShtii">\"Yeah, I do,\" I reply.</string>
    <string name="ch3BekShtiiAsksMeToVisit">\"You drank from my blood and became a false spirit, which is an act of sacrilege. Normally, such acts are punished, but I will forgive you under one condition. My siblings and I want to learn more about you. Therefore, I want you to come to our home. We live in the ancient ruins of our city, and you can find it in the forest to the west.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IsItWesternContinentalPark">\"The forest to the west? Are you talking about the Western Continental Park?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch3BekShtiiAsksMeToStay">\"Correct, but there is a problem. The park is not open to the entire public at the moment, and flying over the park as a spirit might draw the ire of the park rangers. Stay here for today, as I will return here tomorrow to share a plan with you.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3BekShtiiLeaves">Bek\'Shtii finally leaves. It seems like I have the rest of the day to myself. I wonder what I should do.</string>
    <string name="ch3IVisitCaitlyn">I decide to visit Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynPlaysWithFoxtrot">I walk in on Caitlyn playing with Foxtrot the Ferret, one of Arcticon\'s most beloved test animals. Caitlyn waves a plush toy above Foxtrot, and Foxtrot stands up and claws at it. \"Get it, Foxy! Get it!\" says Caitlyn. Caitlyn turns and looks at me. \"Kadey, how\'ve you been?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3IAmAllRight">\"I\'m all right, I guess.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynAsksIfIWasEmbarrassed">\"Did I embarrass you when we pretended you were a baby?\" asks Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3IAdmitEmbarrassment">\"A little bit,\" I admit.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynHugsMe">\"Oh, heheh. Sorry about that,\" she says, hugging me.</string>
    <string name="ch3CanCaitlynAskPersonally">\"One more thing, can I ask you a personal question?\" says Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch3IReplyOK">\"Okay,\" I reply.</string>
    <string name="ch3WouldCaitlynBeGoodMother">\"Do you think I would be a good mother?\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IThink">I think about it for a moment.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynWouldBeGoodMother">Yeah, probably. You\'re definitely friendly enough.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynThanksMe">\"Thanks,\" Caitlyn says, blushing.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynMightBeGoodMother">\"I\'m not sure. I\'m not much of a family person, so you might want to ask someone who is more knowledgeable about that.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynAdmitsGoodIdea">\"Yeah, that\'s a good idea,\" Caitlyn admits.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynJustifiesMotherhood">Caitlyn adds, \"I guess I studied medicine in the first place so that I could care for other people, and if I had kids, they\'d look up to me when I took care of them. I don\'t know. Sorry. Was this a stupid question?\"</string>
    <string name="ch3HowDidCaitlynFeelPossession">\"When we drove from the city, how did you feel when I possessed you?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynFeltLightheaded">\"Oh, I felt light-headed for a second, and then I just went to sleep. Nothing hurt or anything.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IAscertainCaitlynsUnconciousness">\"So you weren\'t conscious while I was possessing you? You can\'t remember anything during that time?\" I ask, wanting to confirm.</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynOnlySlept">\"I can\'t. It felt like I was just going to sleep, and then a few moments later, I woke up. That\'s it.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IThankCaitlyn">\"I see. Thanks, Caitlyn.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynAcceptsThanks">\"No problem,\" Caitlyn responds.</string>
    <string name="ch3HowDidIFeelDuringPossession">\"How did you feel when you possessed me?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3IEnjoyedPossession">\"I really enjoyed it, actually.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynLikesBeingClose">\"I see. I never realized how close you wanted to be to me,\" Caitlyn says, blushing.</string>
    <string name="ch3PossessionFeltWeird">\"It felt a little bit weird, to be honest.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3CaitlynFeltWeird">\"Yeah, it felt weird to me, too. I guess that\'s something we won\'t do again,\" Caitlyn shrugs.</string>
    <string name="ch3WasCaitlynsQuestionWeird">\"It wasn\'t weird of me to ask that, was it?\" Caitlyn asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3ILikeTalkingWithCaitlyn">\"No. Besides, I\'m fine with talking once in a while. Thank you. Take care, Caitlyn.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3IVisitYukio">I decide to visit Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch3YukioWorks">I see Yukio working on a computer. He turns around when he hears me walk in. \"Yes, Kaden?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch3IsYukioUnimpressed">\"You didn\'t take long to go back to work. Did my breakthrough not impress you for long?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch3YukioLecturesMe">\"It is not that. Of course developing a compound that changes its consumer\'s form is a significant accomplishment. Kaden, you have good ideas, and sometimes, you execute them well, and I am certain that the science community values you for that. However, I want to talk about your work ethics. For example, you lied to our supervisor about the compound that you were working on actually was. Then, you managed to convince him to have Caitlyn and I help you with it. This morning, you asked Caitlyn to drive you back here. She is not your chauffeur. She is your coworker, as am I. You are not our boss. You, Caitlyn, and I are equal in rank. It is no secret that Caitlyn has a soft spot for us two, but you seem to take it for granted.\"</string>
    <string name="ch3ITakeCharge">I fold my arms and reply to him, \"Thanks for your feedback, Yukio, but I only take charge because I\'m the smartest one here. Take care.\" I leave the room.</string>
    <string name="ch3ISleep">I decide to sleep until tomorrow.</string>
    <string name="ch4Title">Chapter 4</string>
    <string name="ch4TimeAgo">15 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch4FieldTripBegan">I was on a field trip that day. I was with my class at the Science History Museum. Our tour guide, a retired scientist, showed many different inventions and the various breakthroughs in physics, biology, chemistry, and other sciences. Later in the tour, the guide, now visibly exhausted and sweating, showed us some chemical compounds made by one of the greatest alchemists of the early modern period. These exhibits intrigued me. \"I\'ve met a good many geniuses throughout my life. Who knows, perhaps the next great innovator is with us now,\" said the tour guide.</string>
    <string name="ch4BobbyTeasedMe">\"Wow, Alex is such a dweeb for actually liking this stuff,\" said one of the students, noticing my interest.</string>
    <string name="ch4RebeccaDefendedMe">\"Come on, Bobby, leave Alex alone,\" said a girl, defending me.</string>
    <string name="ch4RebeccaComfortedMe">\"Are you okay, Alex?\" she asked.</string>
    <string name="ch4RebeccaLookedFamiliar">\"Yeah, I\'m fine. Thanks, though. Wait … you look familiar.\"</string>
    <string name="ch4RebeccaLivedDownstairs">The girl laughed, comfortingly, \"I\'m Rebecca, Rebecca Davis. You know, I am in the same apartment building as you, just one floor down.\"</string>
    <string name="ch4IThankedRebecca">\"Oh, yeah, I remember now. I guess I\'m not that good with remembering people. Heheh,\" I laughed, awkwardly. \"Thanks again … Rebecca.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5Title">Chapter 5</string>
    <string name="ch5BekShtiiWakesMe">\"Wake up,\" says Bek\'Shtii. I\'m groggy, but I eventually come to my senses. \"I have a plan for you to reach our home. In two days, students from St. Josephine\'s Secondary School will go on a field trip to the Western Continental Park. You need to go to that school, possess a student there, and get on that field trip.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5PlanIsRoundabout">\"That sounds like a roundabout way to get to your ancient city. Is it really so bad for me to go straight there like this?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5RangersCannotCaptureMe">\"Yes, if the park rangers see you, they might capture you on surveillance video. If you appear on video, then the modern world will have proof that spirits, even false spirits like you, still exist. If that happens, even more people will try to seize power from us. It is bad enough that you already have done so.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IEnterVent">Bek\'Shtii points to the vent on my wall. \"Use the ventilation system to leave your underground complex and go south to the suburban district of New Ferando. Stay behind the tree line as you follow the highway. As a false spirit, you can run quickly without exhaustion. You have little more than an hour before sunrise. Go, now.\" I nod and fly through my vent.</string>
    <string name="ch5IExitVent">After a minute of navigating upwards through the Arcticon vent system, I reach the surface. I have my clothes reappear on me, just like last time, and run alongside the quiet, nearly-empty highway.</string>
    <string name="ch5IReachSchool">I eventually reach St. Josephine\'s Secondary School. It\'s not daylight just yet, but I see a building on the campus that is most likely a dormitory. I see a window that is slightly open, so I fly up through it.</string>
    <string name="ch5IPossessElodie">I see two single beds, both of which had people sleeping in them. It was too dark to see who they were, so I take my chances and jump into one of them.</string>
    <string name="ch5CarleighWakesMe">I must have fallen asleep for at least an hour, since when I regain consciousness, the sun is shining brightly outside. \"Ellie, Ellie! Wake up! We need to go to class,\" says a girl from the other bed. Some of my hair is covering my eyes, so I brush it aside. I get out of bed and walk to a nearby mirror.</string>
    <string name="ch5ISearchElodiesMemory">In the mirror, I see that I\'m a young, adolescent girl. This would be a good time to know more about my host. I concentrate and am able to access basic parts of my host\'s memory. I can\'t get any specific memories, really, just enough general information for me to understand who I am. It seems that I am now Élodie Noël, or \"Ellie\" for short. I was born to a father from the mainland and a mother from the eastern continent. I am currently in eighth grade at St. Josephine\'s Secondary School, which is a non-state boarding school that serves grades 6-12.</string>
    <string name="ch5IDressSlowly">\"Don\'t take too long getting dressed,\" smiles the other girl in the room. That girl is Carleigh Lexington, apparently a good friend of mine. Carleigh has a brother, Hewitt, who also attends St. Josephine\'s.</string>
    <string name="ch5INodAtCarleigh">\"Right,\" I nod at Carleigh.</string>
    <string name="ch5IDressElodie">I change out of my pajamas into my school uniform. It takes a few minutes to put on everything. When I\'m done, I see myself in a dress shirt with a blazer and a necktie. I\'m also wearing a tartan skirt, medium-length socks, and color-matching shoes. I have to admit, I actually like this look, but … what situation have I put myself in? Back when I startled that police officer when I first got my ability, I was intimidating, I was powerful. Now, who am I? Some schoolgirl? Eh, this feels like a downgrade. At least, like this, I\'ll have an easy time staying beneath suspicion.</string>
    <string name="ch5IEnterLiteratureClass">Carleigh and I have the same first class: literature; so we go to the classroom together. In class, the instructor greets us, saying \"Good morning, class! Today, I have a short story to share with you, called \'Paul and the Troubles of Peer Pressure\'. Everyone, get into your reading groups, and I\'ll pass out the story. Read it with your group, share your thoughts, and fill out the questionnaire that I have right here, when you\'re done.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IReadPaulsStory">I get into a group consisting of Carleigh and a couple of her friends. The story is about a boy, named \"Paul\", who succumbs to peer pressure and tries to imitate and fit in with the popular students at his school. Near the end, the wise adults tell him to be himself, since trying to be like another person wouldn\'t make him happy. Basically, the story tells its message in the most heavy-handed way possible. After our group reads the story, we discuss its meaning.</string>
    <string name="ch5WhyDidPaulWantToFitIn">Carleigh reads aloud the questionnaire that the instructor had handed out. \"First question: \'Why did Paul want to fit in with his peers?\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch5BadWriting">\"Because of bad writing?\" asks Carleigh\'s friend.</string>
    <string name="ch5PutWhatTeacherWants">\"Sure, but let\'s put something that the teacher wants to read.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5PaulHadNothingUnique">\"Okay, because … Paul didn\'t feel like he had anything unique about him?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5SureCarleighWrites">\"Sure, I\'ll write that.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5WasPaulJustified">\"Second question: \'On a scale from one to ten, how justified were Paul\'s actions?\' I\'ll answer this one. Three.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5WhyBeYourself">Ugh, this class activity is terrible. I never felt peer pressure as my old self, even when I was younger. I never understood this issue. Carleigh continues, \"Final question: \'What is the number one reason why you should be yourself?\' Ellie, do you want to answer this one?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5SureISay">\"Sure,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch5YouCannotLowerYourself">\"The number one reason why you should be yourself is …\n\n… that you can\'t play to your strengths if you lower yourself to someone else\'s level.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CannotAssociateWithLowlyPeople">\"Yeah, you can\'t associate with those lowly people,\" says Carleigh jokingly.</string>
    <string name="ch5YouNeedToStayConfident">\"The number one reason why you should be yourself is …\n\n… that it\'s how you keep your self-confidence and stay happy.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CarleighWasTeased">\"You have a point, but we all have been teased for being ourselves,\" sighs Carleigh.</string>
    <string name="ch5YouAvoidStupidity">\"The number one reason why you should be yourself is …\n\n… that you might follow someone stupid. If you know your role model isn\'t stupid, then it\'s okay to not be yourself, because the role model is obviously doing something right.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IAmPragmatic">\"Being pragmatic, eh? Interesting answer,\" says Carleigh.</string>
    <string name="ch5WasActivityTerrible">\"Done,\" says Carleigh. Phew, finally. I ask my groupmates if they thought that this activity was terrible too.</string>
    <string name="ch5WriterThinksKidsAreDumb">\"Yeah, whoever wrote this thinks kids like us are dumb, like we can\'t think for ourselves,\" replies Carleigh\'s friend.</string>
    <string name="ch5IPassByCheerleader">Class finally ends, and I go through the halls to my second class. On my way, I pass by an older girl in a cheerleading uniform.</string>
    <string name="ch5CheerleaderTripsMe">The girl looks at me and trips me. \"Why don\'t you go back to your own country, dweeb?\" she laughs. Ugh, I don\'t have time to deal with her now, so I move on.</string>
    <string name="ch5HewittConsolesMe">A few more hours pass until lunch break. I head to the cafeteria and buy lunch. I find Carleigh and Hewitt at a table, and I sit and eat with them. Hewitt looks at me, \"One of my sister\'s friends said that she saw a cheerleader be mean to you. If that happens, don\'t worry about it; those people are just jealous, and they don\'t deserve your attention.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CheerleaderIsJealous">\"You\'re right, they are just jealous,\" I say, agreeing with Hewitt.</string>
    <string name="ch5CanIStudyWithCarleigh">\"Oh, Ellie,\" adds Carleigh, \"can you help me study with a math test?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IEnterLibrary">I know I\'ve technically never met Carleigh until today, but it feels like I\'ve known her for a long time. I can\'t let her down. I have to help her. \"Yeah, I can help you with math,\" I say. We finish our lunch, and Carleigh and I go to the school library.</string>
    <string name="ch5ISeeCarleighsTextbook">Carleigh opens her math textbook and shows it to me. The math looks familiar to me. As a scientist, I use math on a somewhat regular basis. The only difference is that, in the professional field, I do mathematics with a computer. Here in school, I\'ll have to do that math by hand. Hopefully, my written math skills haven\'t faded away yet. \"Are you ready to help?\" whispers Carleigh.</string>
    <string name="ch5IPrepareToPossessCarleigh">\"Yes,\" I whisper back. What Carleigh doesn\'t realize is that my help is going to be more … direct than she expects. I look around to see if anyone else in the library is looking at us.</string>
    <string name="ch5IPossessCarleigh">When it\'s safe, I jump into Carleigh, possessing her.</string>
    <string name="ch5IExamineCarleigh">I look down at myself to see if the possession worked. Everything looks fine. I look over at Élodie. She looks a bit dazed, and I assume that she wasn\'t conscious while I was possessing her. \"Hey … Ellie, we\'re in the library. Let\'s go outside,\" I whisper.</string>
    <string name="ch5ILeaveLibrary">\"What?\" Élodie yawns. I let Élodie lean on my shoulder, and I walk her out of the library.</string>
    <string name="ch5WhyIsElodieHere">\"Why are we here?\" asks Élodie.</string>
    <string name="ch5ElodieIsExhausted">\"It\'s noontime. You and I were working hard in class earlier. If you don\'t remember anything, then it\'s probably from all of the exhaustion,\" I lie to her.</string>
    <string name="ch5ElodieIsDizzy">\"Okay, Carleigh. I\'m dizzy. I need to sit down. Maybe we can talk after classes. I\'m sorry.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IEnterMathClass">The bell rings. I brush my hair back, straighten my necktie and blazer, and head to my math class.</string>
    <string name="ch5IStartMathTest">Once class starts, the math instructor passes out the test and asks the class to be quiet. I read over the test and then write \"my\" name at the top of the paper. \"Carleigh Lexington\", I think that I spelt that right. Now, onto the test.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion1">Question 1: \"Farmer McBilly has 40 m of fence that he can use to enclose his livestock. McBilly wants to give his animals the most room to move around in. McBilly hires an Honors Math student from the local school to lay out his enclosure. What is the largest size that McBilly\'s enclosure can be?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion1CorrectAnswer">The largest size from 40 m of fence is …\n\n… 10 m × 10 m.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion1IncorrectAnswer">The largest size from 40 m of fence is …\n\n… 6 m × 14 m.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion4">Question 4: \"Four doctoral graduates celebrate by eating dinner at a restaurant. The table that they are seated at had four chairs, but the graduates cannot decide who will sit where. How many possible ways can the graduates sit at the table?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion4IncorrectAnswer">The number of combinations of seating for 4 people is …\n\n… 16.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion4CorrectAnswer">The number of combinations of seating for 4 people is …\n\n… 24.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion9">Question 9: \"A boy is making a necklace for his girlfriend. He wants to put a gem lookalike inside the necklace\'s pendant. He pours silica into a gemstone-shaped mold and burns it, turning the silica into glass. The boy plans to stain the glass with the color of his girlfriend\'s birthstone. Before the boy colors the glass, he must cut it into a right triangle to fit it inside the pendant. If one side of the fake gem is 9 mm and the other is 12 mm, then how long is the fake gem\'s hypotenuse?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion9IncorrectAnswer">A right triangle with sides of 9 mm and 12 mm has a hypotenuse of …\n\n… 10.5 mm.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathQuestion9CorrectAnswer">A right triangle with sides of 9 mm and 12 mm has a hypotenuse of …\n\n… 15 mm.</string>
    <string name="ch5MathClassEnds">After finishing all of the questions, I turn in my paper. At the end of class, the instructor says, \"There won\'t be any class tomorrow, but you can still come to pick up your graded tests. Have a good field trip, everyone!\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IReencounterCheerleader">On my way to my next class, I pass the cheerleader who tripped me when I was Élodie. She doesn\'t notice me, but I do see her entering the gym. She probably has physical education next class period. This is a good time for revenge.</string>
    <string name="ch5IEnterLockerRoom">I go into the locker room and look for a girl who is about the same age as that cheerleader. I find a taller girl changing out of her normal school uniform, in an aisle of lockers, all by herself.</string>
    <string name="ch5IPossessAnanya">I walk up to the girl and possess her.</string>
    <string name="ch5IDressAnanya">I am now Ananya Sanjeet. I am in eleventh grade, and I am a member of my school\'s track and field club. I finish taking off my current uniform and put on the T-shirt and athletic shorts that were in my locker. After doing so, some of my hair falls in front of my face. I also notice that I have a hair tie on my wrist.</string>
    <string name="ch5ITieAnanyasHair">Since I don\'t want to constantly adjust my hair during physical education, I use the tie to tie my hair in a ponytail. I look in the mirror in my locker, and it seems that I did a fairly decent job. I lock my locker and head to the gym.</string>
    <string name="ch5IEnterPEClass">When gym class begins, we line up for attendance. I see the cheerleader in the line across from mine. I narrow my eyes and smirk.</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachLectures">After attendance, the coach begins his lecture, \"You are all bright young men and women, and you have the rest of your lives ahead of you. Today, I am going to teach you some basic self-defense so that you can keep that life safe. As many of you know, almost all of the industrialized world bans civilians from possessing firearms, including our country. It\'s been like this for over a decade, and it has been keeping us safe. Now, some rural areas are exempt from the firearms ban, but we won\'t be focusing on those today. Anyway, the problem is that criminals have an obvious tendency of not playing by the rules. It is possible, even if not likely, that, one day, one of them will use a gun to threaten you. Can anyone tell me what they would do if a criminal threatened them with a gun?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IRaiseHand">I have a good answer to this question. I raise my hand, and the coach calls on me, \"Yes, Ananya?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IWouldSubmit">\"I would just listen to what the criminal says.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachRespondsToSubmission">\"Ananya probably did the smartest thing,\" the coach says. \"When staying alive is your priority, you don\'t necessarily need to be a hero. Compliance might seem cowardly to some of you, but it\'s really not. Even if the criminal decides to rob you, for example, losing whatever cash you had on hand is a small price to pay for saving your life, and the police might be able help you once you\'re safe and are able to contact them.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IWouldRun">\"I would run away.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachRespondsToRunning">\"So Ananya decided to run away before the criminal could hurt her,\" the coach says. \"It really depends on where you are, but this is generally one of the worse options. In an open area, running away can immediately be a costly mistake. Even in an area with more cover, the criminal can react to you fleeing and shoot you in a matter of seconds. Remember, guns are ranged weapons.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IDisagreeWithCoach">The coach disagrees with me, but even still, he\'s not in a position to give advice on that type of self-defense.</string>
    <string name="ch5IWouldDisarm">\"I would twist the gun out of his hand and attack him.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachRespondsToDisarming">\"So Ananya decided to be bold and overpower our bad guy,\" the coach says. \"If, and only if, you are sure that you are stronger than the criminal, then disarming him becomes a possible option. If you succeed, then you can gain control of the situation. However, more often than not, victims who attempt this fail. In fact, last year, two out of every five gun-related deaths here in the western continent were due to over-confidence of the victim. Be careful.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachStartsSpar">\"Thank you, Ananya. Okay, class, we\'re going to practice defensive martial arts. Everyone, take the mats that are rolled up on the wall over there and lay them across the gym floor.\" We all lay out the mats as instructed and we take off our shoes. \"All right, now find a partner and practice what we did last time.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IPartnerWithCheerleader">Without hesitation, I walk up to the cheerleader and ask her if she wants to spar with me. At first, she looks at me weirdly. \"Uh … okay, I guess,\" she shrugs. We start off by exchanging some light punches between each other.</string>
    <string name="ch5CheerleaderAndISpar">My spar with the cheerleader gets more intense as we both concentrate. Eventually, the cheerleader tries to hook me, but she\'s too slow. I dodge to her side, grab her shoulder, and …</string>
    <string name="ch5IPinCheerleader">… I carefully pin the cheerleader to the floor mat.</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachCheersMe">\"Nice counter, Ananya!\" says the coach. I help the cheerleader up, but she sneers at me.</string>
    <string name="ch5IKickCheerleader">… I kick the cheerleader in the leg.</string>
    <string name="ch5CheerleaderFalls">I hear the cheerleader\'s blood vessels crack. \"Ow!\" yells the cheerleader, dropping to the mat.</string>
    <string name="ch5IBringCoachToCheerleader">I run to the coach and say, \"Coach! My partner is hurt. Can you take a look?\" The coach follows me to the cheerleader.</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachAsksWhatHappened">\"What happened?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch5CheerleaderIsBruised">\"This Ananya dweeb kicked me! Now my calf is going to be all bruised!\" she whines.</string>
    <string name="ch5IApologizeToCheerleader">\"It was an accident. I\'m so sorry,\" I say, feigning concern. The coach helps her stand up. \"I hope you get better,\" I lie to her.</string>
    <string name="ch5CoachTellsMeToBeCareful">\"Ananya, be more careful next time,\" says the coach.</string>
    <string name="ch5INodAtCoach">\"Okay, I will,\" I nod.</string>
    <string name="ch5PEClassEnds">A few minutes later, the coach instructs us to go back to our locker rooms and change before the bell rings so that we can get to our next classes on time.</string>
    <string name="ch5IDispossessAnanya">Instead of going to the locker room, however, I jog over to the dormitories, stand under the window of Élodie\'s room, and jump out of Ananya and fly through the window.</string>
    <string name="ch5IHideInTheCloset">No one\'s here yet. I hide in the closet for a couple of hours. Eventually, Élodie comes into the bedroom and lies on the bed.</string>
    <string name="ch5IRepossessElodie">I should probably possess Élodie now, before Carleigh comes back too, so I do.</string>
    <string name="ch5IRelax">After possessing Élodie, I stay lying on the bed for a bit longer.</string>
    <string name="ch5ICallCaitlyn">Carleigh still isn\'t back yet. I might as well call Caitlyn and Yukio and let them know what I\'ve been doing. After all, they\'re probably already worried that I\'m not at the Arcticon Research Facility. If I call them when Carleigh comes back, it\'ll be awkward if she overhears me. Otherwise, if I don\'t call them at all today, then Caitlyn and Yukio will just get more worried.</string>
    <string name="ch5IGreetCaitlyn">\"Hello, Caitlyn. It\'s me, Dr. Kaden, again.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5AmIOK">\"Kadey? Where are you? Who are you? Are you okay?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5ITellCaitlynAboutSchool">\"Yeah, I\'m fine. I\'m … uh …\" Oh, this is a problem. I\'m not sure if I should tell Caitlyn about the native gods who were talking to me. \"I left Arcticon to get some fresh air. Some people were nearby, and they were about to see me, so I possessed the nearest person whom I could find, and I ended up becoming an adolescent girl. I can\'t come back until … it\'s safe and no one can see me. Maybe a couple of days.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CaitlynOffersToDrive">\"Oh, I\'m sorry to hear you\'re stuck like that. Do you want me to drive you back here now, Kadey? We can pretend that you\'re my daughter. I\'d be fine with that.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IDeclineCaitlynsOffer">\"There\'s no need, Caitlyn. I just realized that I can fly through Arcticon\'s ventilation system to enter and leave as I please.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5OK">\"Okay.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5YukioWantsToTalk">\"Wait, Kadey,\" Caitlyn says, \"Yuki is right here with me. He wants to talk to you.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5YukioGreetsMe">\"Hello? Kaden?\" asks Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch5IGreetYukio">\"Hello,\" I reply.</string>
    <string name="ch5YukioDislikesMeGettingFreshAir">\"I do not believe that \'getting fresh air\' is a sufficient excuse to not come to work.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IWillCallSupervisor">I groan. \"Listen, Yukio,\" I say, \"if it makes you feel better, then I\'ll call our supervisor and say that I\'m on a field study.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IAmApathetic">\"Do so. Also, Kaden, you might not believe me, but I wanted to work well with you, just like Caitlyn does. However, you have shown apathy towards other people, and continuing to be apathetic will hurt you.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IApologizeToYukio">\"Okay, fine, Yukio. I\'ve wanted to complete this project for years, and I\'ve only just completed it two days ago. If I haven\'t been focusing on the needs of other people recently, then I\'m sorry. That\'s just how it is.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5YukioDismissesMe">\"Goodbye, Kaden,\" sighs Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch5YukioIsWrong">I go back to lying on my bed. Yukio said that I don\'t care about other people, but that\'s not true. I mean, I helped Carleigh earlier with math. Yeah, I\'m not a selfless caregiver or anything, but still, what does Yukio do that makes him think that\'s he\'s better than me?</string>
    <string name="ch5IThinkTooLong">Eh, I\'ve gone on long enough.</string>
    <string name="ch5CarleighReturns">Carleigh eventually comes back. \"Hey Ellie,\" she says.</string>
    <string name="ch5HowWasCarleighsMath">\"Hey Carleigh,\" I say. \"How did your math test go?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CarleighForgets">\"This might sound weird,\" she says, \"but I\'m actually not sure. I barely even remember being in math class. Around when you were helping me, things seemed to go by like a blur. I was even about to go to PE class at the wrong time. It sounds silly. I know.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CarleighWillBeStar">\"Well, I hope that I was able to turn you into St. Josephine\'s new star student,\" I laugh.</string>
    <string name="ch5ElodieCanBeCool">\"Shut up, Ellie,\" Carleigh laughs back, embarrassed. \"Anyway, I have to admit, you can be pretty cool sometimes.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5CarleighAndILaugh">\"Only sometimes, huh?\" I ask, smiling. \"Okay, well … I\'ll still take it as a compliment.\" We both keep laughing.</string>
    <string name="ch5HewittCallsMe">Later, in the evening, my phone rings. \"Hello? Ellie? It\'s Hewitt.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IGreetHewitt">\"Hey, Hewitt,\" I reply.</string>
    <string name="ch5CanIHangOutWithHewitt">\"Thanks for helping my sister today. You\'ve always been a great friend to both of us. Hey, since tomorrow\'s the last day before the field trip, do you think you can hang out with me after class?\"</string>
    <string name="ch5IMightHangOutWithHewitt">Well, this caught me off guard. I\'m supposed to be meeting those gods, not to go on some playdate. On the other hand, I don\'t want to let Hewitt down. \"Maybe, Hewitt,\" I say. \"I\'ll let you know my decision tomorrow at lunch.\"</string>
    <string name="ch5ISleep">It gets late, and we decide to go to sleep.</string>
    <string name="ch6Title">Chapter 6</string>
    <string name="ch6TimeAgo">11 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch6IDatedRebecca">I was on a week-long break from school. That evening, Rebecca and I went out to eat dinner together. We walked to the main city square. The weather was cool. The signs on the surrounding buildings were so colorful and brightly lit that it contrasted so well with the dark sky.</string>
    <string name="ch6RebeccaPhotographedUs">Rebecca even took a photograph of us standing in front of Main Avenue.</string>
    <string name="ch6WeWentToRestaurant">We got hungry. \"Hey Alex,\" Rebecca smiled, holding my hand. \"How about that restaurant?\' she asked, pointing with her other hand. I agreed, and we went in there.</string>
    <string name="ch6WeAte">We were seated at a booth. I ordered a toasted ham sandwich, and Rebecca ordered a lean chicken salad. Both of our meals were seasoned with the west\'s signature herbs. Everything was just about perfect. \"Have any plans for the rest of our break?\" Rebecca asked.</string>
    <string name="ch6IWillCompute">\"Nah, I\'ll just be using my computer.\"</string>
    <string name="ch6RebeccaWillPostPhoto">\"Okay, well, I\'ll be with my other friends, and I\'ll be sure to tell them all about this. Speaking of computers, though, I\'ll probably post our picture online to my friends. I can send it to you, too, if you want.\"</string>
    <string name="ch6IKissedRebecca">We finished our meals. I thanked Rebecca for going out with me and gave her a quick kiss. She hesitated. \"Okay, lover boy,\" she joked, \"we should go home before it gets even darker,\" and so we left.</string>
    <string name="ch7Title">Chapter 7</string>
    <string name="ch7SleepyHead">\"Good morning, again, Sleepy Head!\"</string>
    <string name="ch7ISnoreAtSezja">\"Oh, it\'s you again?\" I snore.</string>
    <string name="ch7WasSezjaCarleigh">\"Wait, you\'re in Carleigh! Were you her the whole time?\" I ask Carleigh, who is obviously possessed by Sezja.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaFingersChin">\"Maybe, maybe not,\" Sezja-as-Carleigh says, with her finger on her chin … with his finger on his chin … with Sezja placing Carleigh\'s finger on Carleigh\'s chin. You get the idea.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaAsBestFriend">I stare in shock at Sezja. \"Ooh! You should see the look on your face! It\'s so cute!\" he says. \"Seriously though, I just possessed this girl this morning,\" he admits. \"Oh, but this is so great! We can be best friends forever, like I\'ve always dreamt of!\"</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaHugsMe">Sezja runs towards me and hugs me, squeezing my chest in the process. Seriously, he\'s squeezing my chest. I think he\'s doing it on purpose, too.</string>
    <string name="ch7WhyIsSezjaHere">\"So, why are you here?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaStaysWithMe">\"Oh, my brother asked me to visit you to see if you were adjusting well. You\'re obviously just fine. I\'m supposed to be heading back now, but … I think I\'ll stay with you, for fun!\" Sezja-as-Carleigh enthuses.</string>
    <string name="ch7CanSezjaActNormal">\"Can you at least act normal if you\'re going to be Carleigh?\" I ask. Sezja shrugs.</string>
    <string name="ch7IReturnToLiteratureClass">In literature class, I get back into my group from yesterday. The instructor passes back the group paper that the real Carleigh and her friends wrote with me.</string>
    <string name="ch7LostCreditForLoweringSelvesForLiterture">\"Aw, we lost two-thirds credit on the last problem,\" Carleigh\'s friend says. \"The teacher didn\'t like how we said \'lower ourselves to someone else\'s level\'.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7LiteratureTeacherIsDrag">\"Ugh, this teacher is such a drag anyway,\" says Carleigh\'s other friend.</string>
    <string name="ch7FullCreditForLiterature">\"Hey, we got full credit. Nice!\" Carleigh\'s friend says. \"I guess the teacher bought the \'be happy\' crap that we wrote for the last problem.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7CarleighsGroupCheers">\"Good job, girls,\" says Carleigh\'s other friend.</string>
    <string name="ch7LostCreditForNotBeingOneselfForLiterature">\"Aw, we lost two-thirds credit on the last problem,\" Carleigh\'s friend says. \"The teacher didn\'t like how we said \'it\'s okay to not be yourself\'.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaIsQuiet">Sezja doesn\'t speak much as Carleigh, though that\'s probably for the best.</string>
    <string name="ch7MorningPasses">The rest of my classes before lunch go fine. I don\'t share any of those classes with Carleigh, so I\'m just hoping that Sezja isn\'t ruining Carleigh\'s image.</string>
    <string name="ch7LunchBegins">Finally, it\'s lunchtime. I promised Hewitt that I would tell him whether I wanted to go out with him. I go to the dining area and see Hewitt eating some chicken strips. I sit in front of him. \"Hello, Hewitt.\" Hewitt looks up at me. \"I\'ve thought about when you asked me to hang out with you later this afternoon. My answer is …\"</string>
    <string name="ch7IAcceptHangout">\"… yes. I\'d be fine with hanging out.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7IDeclineHangout">\"… no. I\'m sorry, Hewitt, but I\'m busy today.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerBurpsAtMe">\"Yeah, whatever, Babe,\" burps Hewitt, with food still in his mouth. Gross! \"Now buy me some dessert. This chicken isn\'t filling me up,\" he demands.</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerIsJerk">\"Ugh, you\'re such a jerk,\" I remark.</string>
    <string name="ch7HewittActsDifferent">I stand up and walk away. I don\'t get it. Hewitt seemed all right yesterday. Today, he seems like a completely different person … oh no.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalCallsMe">I pass by the dormitories on my walk. \"Psst! Dr. Kaden, I have wanted to meet you,\" says a voice.</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerReturns">I turn to my side and see a woman standing behind the dormitory building. I walk towards her. Upon closer inspection, I notice that she is leafy and green and is wearing tribal clothing. Before either of us is able to talk, I hear Hewitt shouting behind me, \"Hey Babe, I said get me a dessert! Why are you taking your sweet time?\"</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerNoticesVaNal">Hewitt runs up to me, but then notices the woman next to me. \"Sister?\" says Hewitt, puzzled.</string>
    <string name="ch7HewittDoesNotDeserveBaqer">\"Brother, that boy does not deserve a slob, like you, to possess him.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalDaresToWatchBaqer">\"You were watching me, Sister? How dare you follow me around!\" snaps Hewitt.</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerFollowedMe">\"Hey, you\'re only here because you must have been following me around,\" I say to Hewitt, interjecting.</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerGrabsMe">\"No one was talking to you, Princess!\" says Hewitt, grabbing me by the shirt.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalPullsBaqer">\"Stop!\" yells the woman. She reaches out to Hewitt, and her hands go inside of him. When that happens, Hewitt lets go of me and shrieks in pain.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalSeperatesBaqer">Eventually, the woman pulls something out of Hewitt. It\'s a man! A large, heavy man is being pulled out of Hewitt. The man is wearing no clothing, except for a grass skirt. Eventually, the woman completely separates the man from Hewitt\'s body. Hewitt himself then collapses to the ground.</string>
    <string name="ch7BaqerFlees">\"Let you be cursed, Sister! I\'m going home!\" yells the man, as he runs out of sight.</string>
    <string name="ch7CanIPossessHewitt">\"I am sorry that you witnessed that,\" says the woman. \"My brother lacks discipline. In addition, my brother\'s yelling may have attracted attention. I do not want others to see me like this. Dr. Kaden, would you be all right with switching into that boy over there?\" she asks, pointing at Hewitt.</string>
    <string name="ch7SureINod">\"Sure,\" I nod.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalPossessesElodie">As I possess Hewitt, I notice the woman dissolving into a black vapor. After I\'ve fully possessed Hewitt, the woman absorbs herself into Élodie. After that, Élodie blinks, feels for her own face, and looks down at herself. \"Ah yes, this is good,\" says Élodie. \"Please, Dr. Kaden, let us eat lunch together before the period ends,\" she says. She grabs my hand and takes me to the cafeteria.</string>
    <string name="ch7WeBuyHam">At the cafeteria, I order a ham sandwich. Élodie orders a ham sandwich as well. \"This lunch will be my treat, Dr. Kaden,\" she says, offering to pay.</string>
    <string name="ch7WeEatHam">We eat at a table. Our sandwiches are cold, but I wasn\'t expecting much from a school cafeteria anyway. \"So, I take it that you and your brother are more of these gods that I keep meeting,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalIntoducesHerself">\"Yes, Dr. Kaden. I am Va\'Nal, the goddess of romance. My brother whom you just met is Baqer. All of us gods love each other, even though Baqer can be a handful.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7WhyWillIGoToRuins">\"I see, but haven\'t I met all of you now? Why do I need to go to your ancient city if you\'re all just going to stop by and say \'hi\' to me anyway?\"</string>
    <string name="ch7GoingWillMakeSense">\"Dr. Kaden, it will make sense when the time comes.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaReturns">I see Carleigh coming towards us. \"Hello again, Best Friend,\" Carleigh says to Va\'Nal-as-Élodie. It seems that Sezja is still possessing Carleigh, but doesn\'t realize that I\'m Hewitt now and that Élodie is actually Va\'Nal. Sezja-as-Carleigh sits next to Va\'Nal-as-Élodie and smiles at her.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaCallsVaNalBestFriend">\"I have never heard you call me \'Best Friend\', brother,\" says Va\'Nal.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaMistakesVaNal">\"Oh! Sister! Is that you? I\'m so sorry,\" says a shocked Sezja.</string>
    <string name="ch7IAmHere">\"It is all right,\" says Va\'Nal. \"Your friend is over there,\" she says, pointing at me.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaGreetsMeAgain">\"Hello again, best friend,\" Sezja says, now looking towards me.</string>
    <string name="ch7CanSezjaGetCarleighsTest">\"Hello,\" I say back. \"Sezja, can you remember to get Carleigh\'s math paper?\"</string>
    <string name="ch7WhyDoIAskSezja">\"Uh … sure. Why are you asking?\" Sezja asks.</string>
    <string name="ch7ITookCarleighsTest">\"I helped Carleigh with her math test. Well, really, I just took the test for her,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch7SezjaGetsNervousTalking">\"Hey, hey, that was sweet of you. You really are a most bestest friend!\" Sezja says. \"You seem excited to get your grade back, Best Friend. You can come with me to math class. You can even do the talking. I get nervous talking to most mortals, anyway.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7IGetCarleighsTest">The bell rings as Sezja and I enter the room for Carleigh\'s math class. We approach the instructor. \"Hi, I\'m here to get the test back for my sister, Carleigh Lexington.\" The instructor looks through all of the students\' papers and hands me mine, well, Carleigh\'s. \"Thanks,\" I say, and Sezja and I leave the room.</string>
    <string name="ch7IScore10">My score is 10/10. That\'s perfect! The real Carleigh will love this when she finds out.</string>
    <string name="ch7IScore9">My score is 9/10. That\'s great! The real Carleigh will love this when she finds out.</string>
    <string name="ch7IScore8">My score is 8/10. That\'s good. I wonder how the real Carleigh will feel when she finds out.</string>
    <string name="ch7IScore7">My score is 7/10. I answered all of the difficult questions incorrectly. I hope that I don\'t let down the real Carleigh too much when she finds out.</string>
    <string name="ch7AfternoonPasses">Time passes as I attend the rest of Hewitt\'s classes. I do overhear some students talk about the upcoming field trip from time to time, but otherwise, nothing too special happens.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalEntersDorm">By the evening, I\'ve come to my new dormitory and am now lying on my bed. I hear my bedroom door being opened. I look over and see Élodie entering the room, her blazer now off. \"Va\'Nal?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch7ElodieIsVaNal">\"Yes, it is still I,\" she responds.</string>
    <string name="ch7HowDidVaNalEnter">\"How did you come into the boys\' dormitories?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalPitiesMe">\"A goddess knows her way around,\" she smiles. \"Look at yourself, Dr. Kaden. You are a boy lying on his bed, all alone. It has been years for you, and yet little has changed.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7WhatDoesVaNalMean">\"What do you mean?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch7ISeekCompanionship">\"You seek companionship. Do you not, Dr. Kaden? I can see into your heart. You think of older days. You think of … her. It is not healthy. No matter whose body you are in, your heart remains the same. You need to stop thinking of her before it is too late. I can help.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalStrokesMe">She strokes my forehead. \"For both of our happiness … kiss me.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7IDoNotKissVaNal">\"I can\'t kiss you, Va\'Nal.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7WhatIsWrong">\"What is wrong?\" Va\'Nal asks.</string>
    <string name="ch7WrongAge">\"If I wanted a girlfriend, then I would find someone my own age, with my own body,\" I remind her.</string>
    <string name="ch7IAmHewitt">\"But you are Hewitt now, and I am Élodie. We can be together,\" Va\'Nal says.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalDisintrestsMe">\"I am not interested. I\'m sorry, but I\'m just not. Please, I\'d like to be alone for the rest of the night,\" I say, nodding towards the door.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalAdmitsDisrespect">Va\'Nal looks sad. \"You are right. We would have been disrespecting our hosts anyway,\" she admits.</string>
    <string name="ch7IWillKissVaNal">\"Only if you\'re sure that kissing will help me.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7HeartMustBeCared">\"Of course. The heart is like any other part of the body. It needs to be cared for. I want you to stay well.\"</string>
    <string name="ch7OKINod">\"Okay,\" I nod.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalKissesMe">Va\'Nal leans towards me and kisses. Afterwards, Va\'Nal asks, \"Well, \'Hewey\', how do you feel?\"</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalLeavesBed">\"I feel better. Thank you, Va\'Nal,\" I smile. She smiles back.</string>
    <string name="ch7GodsWillDispossess">\"Before I leave, I want you to know that we will be at our home, expecting you to meet us. Your classmates will be their normal selves, so be careful about what you tell them,\" Va\'Nal says.</string>
    <string name="ch7VaNalLeavesDorm">\"Understood,\" I say, and Va\'Nal walks out the door.</string>
    <string name="ch7ISleep">I change into my pajamas and go to sleep.</string>
    <string name="ch8Title">Chapter 8</string>
    <string name="ch8TimeAgo">10 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch8INeededHelpWithReport">I had to write a book report by next week. I could have written it by myself, but let\'s face it; I was never good with writing papers. It was lunchtime. I walked around the campus, looking for familiar students from my literature class.</string>
    <string name="ch8IMetSarah">I saw Sarah Parson sitting by herself, writing in a journal. I walk up to her. \"Hey, Sarah …\" I said.</string>
    <string name="ch8SarahAskedColdly">Sarah looked up at me. \"Did you need something?\" she coldly asked.</string>
    <string name="ch8DidSarahKnowMe">\"You know me, right? I\'m Alexander Kaden, from literature class,\" I said.</string>
    <string name="ch8OKAndSarahAsked">\"Okay, and …?\" she asked.</string>
    <string name="ch8IAskedSarahForHelp">\"Well, you know how our book report is due next week, right? I know that you\'re really good with reading and writing. I was wondering if we could meet up after class sometime this week and talk about the book. Would that be okay? I could keep you company,\" I smiled.</string>
    <string name="ch8SarahDeclinesHelping">\"Alex,\" she said, \"I don\'t know you that well. Asking me to help is too much.\"</string>
    <string name="ch8RebeccaCouldNotHelp">\"Oh, okay,\" I responded. \"I asked Rebecca earlier to help me, but she said that she couldn\'t, because she wasn\'t reading the same book in her literature class.\"</string>
    <string name="ch8DidIKnowRebecca">\"You know Rebecca?\" Sarah asked.</string>
    <string name="ch8IDatedRebecca">\"Yeah, we\'ve been going out together for a long time now,\" I said.</string>
    <string name="ch8SarahAgreedToHelp">\"Oh,\" Sarah said, worried. \"Listen, Alex, I\'ll help you, but only this one time.\"</string>
    <string name="ch8Thanks">\"Thanks.\"</string>
    <string name="ch8ILookedAtSarahsJournal">I looked at her journal again. \"You really like to write in that. Are you planning to study anything writing-related in university?\" I asked.</string>
    <string name="ch8SarahStudiedJournalism">\"I\'m going to study journalism, actually,\" Sarah said.</string>
    <string name="ch8IWishedSarahLuck">\"Sounds cool. Good luck with that,\" I said.</string>
    <string name="ch8SarahThankedMe">\"Thank you,\" Sarah faintly smiled.</string>
    <string name="ch9Title">Chapter 9</string>
    <string name="ch9IAwaken">Today\'s the field trip. I change out of my pajamas into a casual, camping outfit, since I don\'t need to wear my school uniform for this. Besides, this outfit will be a better job of keeping me mobile.</string>
    <string name="ch9IWaitForBus">I head out of the dormitories to the bus stop in front of the school. Everyone from the school\'s sixth, seventh, and eighth grades is here. It\'s a huge mass of students. I do eventually find Carleigh and Élodie. \"I\'m glad that you made it out here in time. I\'d hate to tell Mom that you slept while the buses left,\" laughs Carleigh.</string>
    <string name="ch9CarleighLikesHewittSleeping">\"You\'d probably like it if I had slept, wouldn\'t you, Sis?\" I respond.</string>
    <string name="ch9ElodieWouldMissHewitt">Carleigh shakes her head, \"No, of course not. If you did, then Ellie would just spend the whole trip talking about how you weren\'t here.\" Élodie shyly nods.</string>
    <string name="ch9IBoardBus">Several large buses stop by the campus to pick us up. Our names are checked off on a list as we enter the buses, one by one. The whole process of everyone boarding the buses takes nearly half an hour, but then, there are a lot of students, so it\'s reasonable to take that long.</string>
    <string name="ch9DidCarleighTalkAboutMathTest">Eventually, our bus drives away from St. Josephine and towards New Ferando\'s highway. Carleigh, Élodie, and I are all sitting together, and we talk during the bus ride. \"Hey Ellie, did I ever tell you about my math test?\" Carleigh asks.</string>
    <string name="ch9CarleighScored10">\"I scored 10/10. That\'ll really boost my grade! Maybe I\'ll be the new star student, after all. Thanks, Ellie.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9CarleighScored9">\"I scored 9/10. That\'ll really boost my grade! Thanks, Ellie.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9CarleighScored8">\"I scored 8/10. I think that\'s pretty good. Thanks, Ellie.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9CarleighScored7">\"I only scored 7/10. It\'s mainly my fault though. I spaced out a bit while you were helping me. I guess I can do that when I\'m nervous. Still, thanks, Ellie.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9OhElodieSays">\"Oh,\" Élodie says, a bit confused.</string>
    <string name="ch9BusExitsHighway">The bus takes an exit on the highway. \"We\'re almost there,\" says a school staffer. We drive on a road surrounded by trees.</string>
    <string name="ch9BusPassesCheckpoint">Up ahead is a secured checkpoint with park rangers. The bus stops at the checkpoint, and the staffer briefly gets out and talks to the gatekeeper. The staffer comes back onto the bus, and we continue driving.</string>
    <string name="ch9IExitBus">We finally reach a lodge. The bus stops and drops us off here. It takes another 10 minutes for the rest of the buses and students to finally arrive.</string>
    <string name="ch9GuideAnnounces">Once everyone\'s here, an adult with a megaphone, presumably our field trip guide, stands in front of the large group. He says, \"Greetings, St. Josephine\'s Secondary School. This is the Western Continental Park, home to a few endangered species, as well as to the ruined ancient settlements of the native people. This building next to me is the main guest lodge. The lodge has common areas that you are all welcome to use during free time. There are also bedrooms upstairs, but there are only enough bedrooms for the grownups. Sorry kids, but you\'ll have to sleep in tents. The park staff will be setting up your tents throughout the day. I\'ll talk more about that in the evening. For now, you kids have an hour while we get everything set up. Now would be a good time to have a snack and take care of any personal business. We\'re going to be doing a lot of walking, so be prepared.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9MuchBuildup">There is so much buildup here, and for what? I just need an opportunity to get into the ancient city ruins. Once I get there, I meet up with the native gods, do whatever they want me to do, and then I ditch this place.</string>
    <string name="ch9IEnterLodge">I enter the lodge and go to its living room. There\'s a television set tuned to the news channel. I decide to watch.</string>
    <string name="ch9SarahStartsInterview">Sarah Parson is on the screen. She\'s sitting in the network\'s interview room. \"So, what happened? From the beginning?\" Sarah asks the off-screen interviewee.</string>
    <string name="ch9OfficerTalks">The screen cuts to the interviewee. \"I was on my regular patrol,\" says the interviewed man. \"I was walking on the sidewalk, passing by several alleys, when I heard a man coughing violently. I looked into the next alley, and I saw the man. He was wearing a blue hooded raincoat and was kneeling down on the ground. I asked him if he was all right. He looked up at me. I couldn\'t see his face. Everything inside his hood was black. Then, two red, glowing eyes showed up, where his face should\'ve been. After that, he jumped at me and knocked me unconscious. The only thing I could remember after that was me waking up just outside my apartment building.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9ISeeMySketch">The screen fades to a sketch of me in my spirit form, with red eyes and everything. The sketch is accompanied by Sarah\'s voiceover, telling viewers that if they have any information regarding me, that they should call the New Ferando Police Department.</string>
    <string name="ch9SarahSignsOut">The screen then fades to Sarah, this time sitting at a desk on the main news set. \"That interview was recorded earlier today. We\'ll have more this evening. Until then, you\'ve been watching New Ferando Network News on KNFN. Thanks for tuning in.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9PublicKnowsMe">Well, this isn\'t good. Now the whole public knows about me.</string>
    <string name="ch9WeStartWalk">Free time is over, and we\'re separated into groups, each lead by a tour guide. We embark on a long nature walk all over the park.</string>
    <string name="ch9WeFindIvy">We pass by poison ivy. \"That\'s poison ivy over there, kids. Don\'t touch,\" the guide says.</string>
    <string name="ch9WeFindPolecats">On our walk, we see polecats climbing nearby trees. \"See those critters in the trees?\" the tour guide asks. \"Those are polecats. They originate from the mainland. Several centuries ago, some explorers from the mainland brought polecats into this continent. We\'ve been keeping the migrated polecats safe here in the park. Nowadays, most polecats have been domesticated into ferrets, and ferrets have become popular household pets.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9WeFindSnakes">Later on in the walk, we see snakes slithering on the ground. \"Careful, kids. Some snakes are venomous. You kids know how to tell whether they\'re venomous, right? My old co-worker Billy told me this saying: \'black and yellow, friendly fellow; red and black, get back\'.\" I\'m not a snake expert, but our tour guide might have gotten that mnemonic wrong. It\'s okay, though. He\'s only endangering a dozen students.</string>
    <string name="ch9WeSeeRuins">We finally pass by a view of the ancient native city, from the side of a hill. \"See that ruined city in the distance?\" the guide asks. \"That was the capital of the western continent\'s indigenous people. We won\'t be entering the city. In fact, we prefer to leave the city\'s architecture undisturbed, so we generally only allow entry during research expeditions.\" Well, that means that this is as far as I\'m going to get as a normal person.</string>
    <string name="ch9ShouldIRun">Hm, should I run for it? I doubt that I can do it without getting noticed, but I might as well make the most out of this opportunity.</string>
    <string name="ch9IDispossessHewitt">I move to the back of the group. When the guide is looking away from the students, I quietly run behind a nearby tree. I dispossess Hewitt and fly through the trees towards the city.</string>
    <string name="ch9GuideSeesBlackBear">\"Woah, stand back, kids!\" says the tour guide, surprised. \"That looked like a black bear. Generally, those bears stay away from us humans, especially adult bears. That bear might have been an adolescent, though, so it might not have learned how dangerous humans are yet. Also, did you know that, unlike polecats, black bears are native to the western continent? It\'s true!\"</string>
    <string name="ch9IEnterRuins">I finally reach the ancient city. It\'s filled with unoccupied stone buildings. I see the largest building in the city. It\'s a giant step pyramid, also made out of stone. I fly up the main stairs of the pyramid. At the top is a ritual room … with the four gods lounging around inside.</string>
    <string name="ch9BaqerGreetsMe">\"Hello, False Spirit. My brother called you that, right?\" asks Baqer. \"You were also that girl from school, weren\'t you? The one who was too lazy to get me dessert. Ah, it\'s typical of your kind. You take, you take, you take. You take our dignity. You take our blood. And what do you give in return? Nothing.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9ICanRedeem">\"Now, now, Brother,\" says Bek\'Shtii, \"Dr. Kaden may be a false spirit, but he can still be our ally if he redeems himself.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9BaqerCannotTrustMe">\"Nuh-uh, this Kaden guy is a perfect example of why his kind isn\'t to be trusted!\" Baqer shouts back.</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiiAndBaqerYell">Bek\'Shtii and Baqer yell at each other. Sezja gets upset. \"Why do you brothers have to argue? This is supposed to be our happy place,\" Sezja cries.</string>
    <string name="ch9GodsAreFlawed">Amidst all of this, Va\'Nal walks towards me. \"I am sorry that you have to see this. Our family is not so different than a mortal family, is it?\" she says, holding my shoulder, trying to comfort me.</string>
    <string name="ch9VaNalsKissIsRuined">\"I had hoped that what you and I did yesterday evening would put you in a good mood, but it seems that Baqer just has to ruin it,\" Va\'Nal says, frowning.</string>
    <string name="ch9GodsAreInappropriate">\"I am sorry if Baqer is making you uncomfortable. He does not know how to act appropriately amongst mortals. I suppose that I do not know how to act appropriately either, considering how I behaved towards you yesterday evening,\" Va\'Nal says, frowning.</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiisNewPlan">\"Okay, okay, here is the plan now,\" Bek\'Shtii says. \"Dr. Kaden, you appeared on television earlier today, did you not?\"</string>
    <string name="ch9YesIAdmit">\"Yes,\" I admit.</string>
    <string name="ch9HowDidBekShtiiKnow">\"Wait, how did you know that?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiiWillEmpower">\"Do not overthink,\" says Bek\'Shtii. \"Nevertheless, if that is the case, then I shall expand your powers, to increase survivability. I only ask that you stay still while I recite a chant.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiiChants">Bek\'Shtii then chants in a language with which I\'m not familiar. Everyone else stands back silently.</string>
    <string name="ch9BeckShtiiFinishesChant">My gaseous form begins to ache. It feels like it\'s condensing. I fall onto my knees. Eventually, Bek\'Shtii finishes his chant. I breathe heavily, recovering from the discomfort.</string>
    <string name="ch9ISolidify">I feel for my face. I can feel it. My face is fleshy and solid. My normal, actual face is back. \"Dr. Kaden, you can now switch between your natural, mortal form and your false spirit form freely,\" Bek\'Shtii tells me. I try it, and, sure enough, I can switch between my two forms just by thinking about it. I stay with my mortal form, for the time being.</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiiExplainsAbilities">\"This should help you move around unnoticed without having to possess another person,\" Bek\'Shtii says. \"You have one more new ability. You can grow tentacles from your back. Try it.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9IExtendTentacles">I try it, and four black, vaporous tentacles come out of my back, two on each side. I can even control them, just like my own arms. \"You can do this even when possessing someone. This might be useful in combat, if you ever need to defend yourself,\" Bek\'Shtii says.</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiiThoughtAhead">\"You really thought ahead, didn\'t you?\" I smile.</string>
    <string name="ch9BekShtiiDismissesMe">\"I will take that as a \'thank you\',\" Bek\'Shtii responds. \"We may need your assistance in the near future. Considering what we have done for you, we find that reasonable. You are free to go,\" Bek\'Shtii says, dismissing me. I turn and walk away.</string>
    <string name="ch9SezjaDismissesMe">\"Have fun with your new powers!\" Sezja says excitedly.</string>
    <string name="ch9VaNalDissmissesMe">\"Keep your spirits up,\" reminds Va\'Nal.</string>
    <string name="ch9BaqerDissmissesMe">\"Yeah, bye,\" groans Baqer.</string>
    <string name="ch9ILeaveRuins">I leave the ancient city and wonder what I will do next. I should probably start by going back home to the Arcticon Research Facility.</string>
    <string name="ch9IEncounterRanger">I encounter an armed park ranger. \"Are you lost, Sir?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch9IAmLeaving">\"No, I went to those ruins over there for a meeting. I\'m on my way out right now,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch9HowDidIEnterPark">The ranger is confused. \"How did you enter this park?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch9ISneakedOntoBus">\"I rode a bus with students earlier today to get in here. I\'m not actually with the school, though,\" I answer truthfully.</string>
    <string name="ch9RangerMustDetainMe">\"Sir, if you\'re not authorized to be here, then I have to detain you,\" the ranger says, pointing his gun at me. Okay, I don\'t need to panic. This reminds me of gym class when I was Ananya Sanjeet. What\'s the best thing to do in this situation?</string>
    <string name="ch9IRemember">Ah, yes, I remember.</string>
    <string name="ch9DoNotRunSaysRanger">\"Don\'t think about running,\" says the ranger. Well, so much for that idea. I take another look at the ranger. I might be able to take him on, anyway.</string>
    <string name="ch9IFalselySurrender">\"Turn around and put your hands behind your back,\" says the ranger. I do so. He approaches me and is about to place restraints on my wrists. Just before he does so, however, I figure that I should take advantage of this.</string>
    <string name="ch9IStealRangersGun">I quickly extend tentacles from my back. I use them to quickly grab the ranger\'s gun away from him.</string>
    <string name="ch9ICrushMagazine">I pull out the magazine from the gun and crush the magazine with my tentacles into dust.</string>
    <string name="ch9IReturnGun">I hand the unloaded gun back to the ranger. \"It\'s a shame that you\'re just doing your job. Now leave me be,\" I laugh.</string>
    <string name="ch9WhoAmI">\"Who are you?\" asks the ranger.</string>
    <string name="ch9RangerKnowsMeOnTV">I change into my spirit form. \"I know you! You were on TV! What are you, exactly? What do you want?\" the ranger gasps.</string>
    <string name="ch9IWantToBeLeft">\"I already told you what I want. I want you to let me leave,\" I respond. The ranger backs away from me. \"You really want to know who I am, don\'t you?\"</string>
    <string name="ch9IAmPhantomOfWest">\"I am the Phantom of the West!\"</string>
    <string name="ch9IFlyAboveContinent">I fly off to the mountains, to Arcticon. As I\'m in the sky, I see the whole western continent.</string>
    <string name="ch9IOverlookNewFerando">I see the tall buildings of New Ferando to the southeast.</string>
    <string name="ch9IOverlookPark">I see the trees of the Western Continental Park to the west.</string>
    <string name="ch9IOverlookArcticon">I see the snowy mountain range to the northeast, home to Arcticon.</string>
    <string name="ch9IOverlookHighway">Finally, I see the highway in the middle, connecting it all together.</string>
    <string name="ch9IEnterArcticon">I reach Arcticon\'s surface entrance. I see a ventilator nearby, so I use it to enter the ventilation system to reach my apartment.</string>
    <string name="ch9IReachMyRoom">Finally, I\'m back in my own bedroom. I should probably tell Caitlyn and Yukio what I\'ve been doing so far. I switch to my mortal form and head out.</string>
    <string name="ch9IGoToLounge">I head over to the staff lounge that Caitlyn and Yukio frequent. It should be their break time soon, and then they\'ll be here.</string>
    <string name="ch9CaitlynAndYukioCome">Break time arrives, and Caitlyn and Yukio enter the lounge shortly thereafter.</string>
    <string name="ch9ThereIAm">\"Oh, there you are,\" says Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch9CaitlynAndYukioWorried">\"Oh, Kadey, Yuki and I were worrying about you. We\'re glad you\'re back,\" says Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch9YukioSawMeOnTV">\"Yes, and we also saw a man talk about you on television this morning. Do you care to explain?\" Yukio asks.</string>
    <string name="ch9DoesCaitlynRemember">\"The television? Oh, that man was the first person that I possessed. Caitlyn, you remember when you drove to New Ferando to pick me up, right?\"</string>
    <string name="ch9CaitlynRemembersOfficer">Caitlyn nods, \"Yeah, that man was a police officer; wasn\'t he? He looks familiar now, now that you mention it.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9IMayReappearOnTV">I continue, \"Well, that might not be the last time that I\'m mentioned on television. Let me explain.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9ISummarizeToYukio">I tell Caitlyn and Yukio my story. \"Okay, so I already told you on the phone how I went outside to get some fresh air, right? And that I was about to be seen and that I had to possess a student? Well, after that phone call, I continued going to school the next day as my new self. Then, the day after that, it turned out that we had to go on a field trip to the Western Continental Park. So, we went there, and we went on a boring hike with some tour guides. In the middle of the hike, gaseous tentacles grew out from my back. It turned out that my powers were expanding. The tour guide got scared and he was about to shoot me, but then I used my tentacles to grab his gun, and I crushed it into tiny bits. Then, I came back here. Also, I can switch between my normal self and my spirit self now.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9YukioSimplifiesMySummary">\"Okay, okay. That is a lot of information to give us at once. Let me understand the basics. Essentially, you are becoming more powerful, and you let yet another outsider discover your powers. Is that correct?\" asks Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch9YeahBasically">\"Yeah, basically.\"</string>
    <string name="ch9IWaitForFoxtrot">Yukio shakes his head and leaves the lounge. \"Don\'t worry too much about Yuki,\" says Caitlyn. \"Also, it seems like you\'ve had an exhausting day. I know just who can help you relax. Stay right there,\" Caitlyn adds, and then leaves the lounge.</string>
    <string name="ch9IAlreadyMetFoxtrot">Caitlyn comes back, this time holding Foxtrot the Ferret. It\'s always good to see him.</string>
    <string name="ch9IDidNotMeetFoxtrot">Caitlyn comes back, this time holding Foxtrot the Ferret, one of Arcticon\'s most beloved test animals.</string>
    <string name="ch9FoxtrotToCheerMeUp">\"Cheer up Dr. Kaden, Foxy!\" encourages Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch9FoxtrotStares">Foxtrot just stares at me. Foxtrot is usually more forthcoming when he sees me, but he doesn\'t seem as comfortable this time. Can he smell the god\'s blood inside of me?</string>
    <string name="ch9ILeaveFoxtrot">I decide to leave Foxtrot alone.</string>
    <string name="ch9CaitlynShouldPutFoxtrotBack">\"Foxtrot looks a bit frightened. Maybe you should put him back, Caitlyn,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch9IWillPetFoxtrot">I decide to pet Foxtrot.</string>
    <string name="ch9FoxtrotHisses">Foxtrot pulls his head back as I move my hand towards him. I keep reaching towards him, but then Foxtrot hisses at me. I put my hand back and give up.</string>
    <string name="ch9FoxtrotAllowsPet">Foxtrot pulls his head back at first as I move my hand towards him. I wait a few moments, and Foxtrot puts his head back forward.</string>
    <string name="ch9IRubFoxtrot">I rub his head, and he seems all right with it.</string>
    <string name="ch9FoxtrotLicksMe">After that, Foxtrot climbs to the top of my shoulder and starts licking my face. Caitlyn laughs, and so do I.</string>
    <string name="ch9CaitlynFrownsAtFoxtrot">Caitlyn frowns at Foxtrot. \"Oh Foxy, it\'s just Dr. Kaden. Oh well,\" she shrugs and leaves.</string>
    <string name="ch9IReturnHome">I eventually head back to my apartment. I could use a rest.</string>
    <string name="ch9ISleep">I decide to go to sleep.</string>
    <string name="ch10Title">Chapter 10</string>
    <string name="ch10TimeAgo">2 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch10WeFinishedDinner">Caitlyn, Yukio, Jim, and I had graduated with our doctoral degrees and were at the Kenyon Imperial Hotel, New Ferando\'s flagship hotel. We had just finished eating dinner at the Yí Mǐn Cāntīng, an eastern-continent-style restaurant and one of several restaurants in the Kenyon Hotel. We were walking through one of the hotel\'s major walkways.</string>
    <string name="ch10WhereDoesYukioWork">\"Where are you going to work?\" Jim asked Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch10ArcticonHiredUs">\"The Arcticon Research Facility is hiring me as a physicist.\" Yukio turned to Caitlyn and me. \"Actually, all three of us were hired there.\"</string>
    <string name="ch10CaitlynResearchesMedicine">\"Yup, I\'m going to be a medical researcher there,\" Caitlyn added.</string>
    <string name="ch10JimIsAssistantProf">\"Oh, well, I guess that leaves me the odd one out,\" Jim said, scratching his head. \"There\'s a university on the mainland that wants me as an assistant professor. It\'s going to be tough working without you guys anymore.\"</string>
    <string name="ch10WeMissedJim">\"We\'ll miss you!\" smiles Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch10CaitlynNoticesRAF">Caitlyn turned around and noticed a sign by the ballroom entrance. \"Kadey, look! The Rescued Animals Foundation is hosting an event in the ballroom right now,\" Caitlyn pointed at the sign, excitedly. \"Oh, I bet they have cute animals in there!\" she continued.</string>
    <string name="ch10WhyDoesCaitlynCallMeKadey">\"You\'ve been calling me \'Kadey\' a lot recently. How come?\" I asked.</string>
    <string name="ch10CaitlynLikesToNickname">\"Oh, well, I guess I like to nickname people as a way of showing affection. You, Yuki, and Jim are all really great friends,\" she blushed, embarrassed. \"Is it okay if I keep calling you \'Kadey\'?\" she asked, worried if she was offending me.</string>
    <string name="ch10IHadNotBeenGoodFriend">I hesitated. \"… Sure, you can keep calling me \'Kadey\' if you want. It\'s been a long time since someone considered me a \'great friend\' anyway,\" I said.</string>
    <string name="ch10WeHadGottenWellTogether">\"Kaden, you do not need to feel like that. All four of us have gotten along well together, considering all things,\" Yukio said, smiling.</string>
    <string name="ch10WeWentToRAF">\"So, do you want to go in, Kadey?\" Caitlyn asked. The Kenyon Imperial Hotel\'s ballroom was a popular location for hosting events, so I decided to go with Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch10WeExploredRAF">There were many people in the ballroom. Among them were representatives from the Rescued Animals Foundation handing out flyers. There were even posters on the wall that mentioned wrongful deaths and abuses of animals, with some other posters saying how we could make a difference.</string>
    <string name="ch10CaitlynLookedAtAnimals">At the front of the ballroom were rescued domestic animals, with each species enclosed in its own pen. Caitlyn walked along the various pens, and I followed her.</string>
    <string name="ch10CaitlynWantedFerret">Caitlyn stopped at a pen with ferrets. \"Oh, they\'re so cute!\" she said. \"Let\'s adopt one! How about that one?\" she asked, pointing at one of the ferrets.</string>
    <string name="ch10IRejectedFerret">\"Come on, Caitlyn. Owning an animal like that is a years-long commitment. We already have ourselves to take care of,\" I replied.</string>
    <string name="ch10PleaseCaitlynAsked">\"Please?\" Caitlyn asked, looking innocently at me.</string>
    <string name="ch11Title">Chapter 11</string>
    <string name="ch11BekShtiiWakesMe">\"I hope that you slept well,\" Bek\'Shtii says. \"You\'re back in my room?\" I ask. \"I am. Also, you may be interested in this,\' he says, handing me an invitation flyer.</string>
    <string name="ch11ReunionWillBeTonight">The flyer is about a reunion for former students of New Ferando State High School, the same school that I attended many years ago. According to the flyer, the reunion will be held in the Kenyon Imperial Hotel ballroom … late tonight!</string>
    <string name="ch11ICannotPrepare">This could be a problem. I don\'t have much time to prepare. I\'ve already missed several days of work, and I should probably talk to my supervisor about why I\'ll be gone today as well. I don\'t have any proper clothes to wear for this type of social event. I haven\'t even booked a room at the Kenyon Hotel, although perhaps that part isn\'t as important, since I can fly back here. I also have to deal with Sarah Parson. I bet the park ranger who saw me yesterday is going to run to the media, and Sarah, or a co-worker of hers, will interview him, and my reputation will be ruined.</string>
    <string name="ch11ICouldPossessSarah">Wait a minute. Sarah went to high school with me. She might go to the reunion tonight. If so, then I could possess Sarah, bias the interview, and go to the reunion as her. I mean, I don\'t have to go to the reunion, but I would be possessing Sarah anyway, and I\'d bet Sarah would have wanted to go. Also, I might see Rebecca there.</string>
    <string name="ch11IReallyWantRebecca">I would really like to see Rebecca there.</string>
    <string name="ch11BekShtiiLeaves">\"You must have read my mind. Thank you,\" I say to Bek\'Shtii. Bek\'Shtii nods and disappears.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGoToLab">It\'s almost the start of the workday. I head to the laboratory where Caitlyn, Yukio, and I work.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWantUsToGoToHotel">\"Hello, Caitlyn and Yukio. I\'m sorry about all of the worrying that I have caused for either of you. I want to make up for it. I want us to drive to the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. There is a major social event being held there. I will let you see my powers firsthand. How about it?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioIsNotPaidToGoWithMe">\"Kaden,\" Yukio says, \"we are supposed to work in the laboratory today. Caitlyn and I are not being paid to go on field trips with you. Perhaps you should start working again as well.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11IWillCallSupervisor">\"Okay, Yukio. I can call our supervisor and get official permission to go to the hotel today. Would you and Caitlyn go with me then?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioShrugs">Yukio shrugs.</string>
    <string name="ch11ICallSupervisor">I call our supervisor. \"Hello? Supervisor? I might have already called you about this, but the reason that I was absent for the last few days was because of an important field study. I wish to continue my study today, but I also wish for Caitlyn Rylie and Yukio Kiyoshi to accompany me. Is that all right with you?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11WeDriveOutOfArcticon">\"Okay, thank you.\" I\'m cleared to go out with Caitlyn and Yukio. I tell them the news, and we leave Arcticon to drive off.</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioDrivesDownHighway">Yukio is driving Caitlyn and me down the highway. It\'s overcast and raining today.</string>
    <string name="ch11KNFNVanPassesUs">I see a KNFN News van pass by us on the other side of the highway. \"Yukio, a news van just headed by us towards the park. I need to check it out. Keep driving with Caitlyn to the Kenyon Hotel. I\'ll contact you later.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11IRollDownWindow">I turn into my spirit form and roll down my car window.</string>
    <string name="ch11IFlyToVan">I jump out of the window and fly towards the news van.</string>
    <string name="ch11ILandOnVan">I land on the van and crawl down to its underside.</string>
    <string name="ch11VanEntersPark">The van goes towards the Western Continental Park and passes through the entrance.</string>
    <string name="ch11VanStopsAtLodge">The van eventually stops by the lodge. It\'s hard to tell, hiding under the news van, but it looks like the students have already left.</string>
    <string name="ch11SarahLooksAtMirror">I see Sarah and the news crew walk out of the vehicle. They talk. Eventually, Sarah walks over to the other side of the van, pulls out a handheld mirror from her pocket, and looks at herself.</string>
    <string name="ch11IPossessSarah">I take this opportunity to possess Sarah.</string>
    <string name="ch11IExamineSarah">I find myself looking at Sarah\'s face in her mirror. I brush my hair back and smirk at my new reflection, before I put the mirror away.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGoToCrew">I go back to the news crew and tell them that I\'m ready.</string>
    <string name="ch11RangerComes">The news crew calls over the park ranger who tried to detain me.</string>
    <string name="ch11WeStartInterview">We all get ready for the news report to be filmed, and we go on the air.</string>
    <string name="ch11AnchorStarts">I hear a news anchor on my earphone. \"The unidentified man who may have assaulted a New Ferando police officer earlier this week strikes again. Sarah Parson joins us live at the Western Continental Park. Sarah?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11IIntroduceRanger">I respond, \"We are here with a park ranger who says that a man attacked him yesterday afternoon.\" I turn to the ranger. \"So, tell us what happened?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11RangerSawMe">\"Well, a coworker of mine was guiding a tour with a group of students. He called me on the radio, saying he saw a black bear who knocked a student unconscious, and he wanted me to investigate while he continued the tour. When I got there, I saw a man in a blue hooded raincoat. I asked him where he came from, and he started answering real aggressively.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11WasIAggressive">\"Aggressively? What did he say specifically? Was he just lost or confused?\" I interject.</string>
    <string name="ch11RangerWasToDetainMe">\"He said he came from the ruins, but the ruins are off-limits. There\'s some very fragile architecture there. I told him I had to detain him.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11WasIDangerous">\"You said that you had to detain him? Was he dangerous? He was not armed or anything, was he?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch11StandardProcedure">\"It\'s just standard procedure, Ma\'am. We value our park greatly, and take pride in keeping it safe.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11GoOnINod">\"Understandable. Please, go on,\" I nod.</string>
    <string name="ch11ISaidIWasPhantomOfWest">\"I was about to handcuff him, but then he took my gun and pulled out the magazine and damaged it. Then, his face turned to black, and his eyes glowed red. He told me that he was the \'Phantom of the West\', and he ran off.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11WhatShouldIKnow">\"He said that his name was the \'Phantom of the West\'? I see. One more thing before we go: if this phantom were here now, what would you want him to know?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11IShouldTurnIn">\"I\'d say he should turn himself in. I don\'t care what kind of powers he has. He has the obligation to act in a civilized manner, just like anyone else.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11RangerMisunderstoodMe">\"Thank you for your time, and I hope that the encounter between you and this phantom was just a misunderstanding,\" I say to the ranger, much to his puzzlement.</string>
    <string name="ch11ISignOff">I turn to the camera. \"This is Sarah Parson at the Western Continental Park. We will keep you updated with any more news regarding this mysterious, handsome, hooded man, here on KNFN.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11AnchorThanksMe">\"Thank you, Sarah,\" says the news anchor on my earphone.</string>
    <string name="ch11WePackUpToVan">The news crew and I pack up our equipment and return to the van.</string>
    <string name="ch11VanDrivesToNewFerando">We drive south, to New Ferando. I take off my earphone. I then look through Sarah\'s memories. It seems that she already booked a room at the Kenyon Imperial Hotel so that she wouldn\'t have to drive in the rain at night and deal with New Ferando\'s congested traffic. Sarah also asked to have a short workday today, for the reunion. I tell the crew to drop me off at the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. The hotel and the KNFN headquarters are only a couple blocks away from each other, so it\'s no big deal for them.</string>
    <string name="ch11IExitVan">We reach the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. I grab my handbag, well, Sarah\'s. I thank the crew and exit onto the sidewalk.</string>
    <string name="ch11IRegroupWithCaitlynAndYukio">I look for Caitlyn and Yukio and find them near the entrance. \"Hello, Caitlyn and Yukio. It\'s me, Dr. Kaden,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch11SecretFantasy">\"Dr. Kaden?\" Yukio asks. \"You possessed Sarah Parson? The journalist? I have to wonder if you are doing this to live out some secret fantasy of yours.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioFlattersMe">\"You complimenting my tastes flatters me, Dr. Kiyoshi,\" I say to Yukio, sarcastically.</string>
    <string name="ch11ILeftMyWallet">Yukio reaches into his pocket and pulls out my wallet. \"You left your wallet in my car,\" he says.</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioPullsBackWallet">I try to take my wallet, but Yukio pulls it back. \"Oh, wait. You are not Dr. Kaden. I am so sorry, Ms. Parson, for mistaking you for him,\" Yukio says, with ridicule.</string>
    <string name="ch11WhatDoesYukioWant">\"Okay, Yukio, what do you want now?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch11WillIBookYukioARoom">\"If Caitlyn and I need to stay here, we need a room. Will you promise to book us one and pay for it?\" Yukio asks.</string>
    <string name="ch11SarahAlreadyBooked">\"Sarah already booked a hotel room for herself. It has two double-sized beds. None of us have to spend any more money,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioNeedsSeparateRoom">Yukio shakes his head and puts his arm around Caitlyn. \"No. Caitlyn and I need separate rooms. I cannot trust Caitlyn with you anymore.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11YukiItsFine">\"Yuki, it\'s fine,\" Caitlyn says, but Yukio ignores her.</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioGivesMeWallet">\"Okay, fine,\" I give in. Yukio finally gives me my wallet.</string>
    <string name="ch11WeEnterHotel">We head through the entrance. The Kenyon Hotel\'s lobby is spacious and well decorated. This hotel is a lot better than that small, no-name hotel that I was at earlier this week.</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioWaitsByEscalator">\"We will be by the escalator, while you get us a room,\" Yukio says. I head to the reception desk.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGreetReceptionist">\"Hi, I booked a room here earlier today,\" I say to the receptionist. \"I was wondering if we could book a second room. I have some last-minute companions.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11ReceptionistBooksRoom">\"Sure,\" the receptionist says. She tells me the cost of the second room and asks me to pay.</string>
    <string name="ch11HowDoIPay">Now, the question is: do I pay for Yukio\'s and Caitlyn\'s room with my money, or with Sarah\'s money?</string>
    <string name="ch11IPayAsMyself">I decide to pay with my own money.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGiveMyCardToReceptionist">I take my payment card out of my wallet and give it to the receptionist. She looks at my card. \"You don\'t look like an \'Alexander Kaden\', Ms.,\" she says.</string>
    <string name="ch11IAmMyBoyfriend">\"Oh, he\'s … my boyfriend,\" I say to the receptionist.</string>
    <string name="ch11ProveIt">\"Prove it,\" the receptionist says, folding her arms.</string>
    <string name="ch11IStare">I stare blankly at her.</string>
    <string name="ch11IdentityTheft">\"I\'m just kidding,\" she laughs. \"We\'re supposed to check for those things now. You remember all of that identity theft our country had last year, right? You\'re fine, though.\" She hands back my card. \"You\'re Sarah Parson, right? It took me a while to recognize you,\" she says. I nod back.</string>
    <string name="ch11AmICute">\"By the way, is this \'Alexander\' cute?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch11YeahIBlush">\"Yeah,\" I respond, blushing.</string>
    <string name="ch11IPayAsSarah">I decide to pay with Sarah\'s money.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGiveSarahsCardToReceptionist">I hand Sarah\'s payment card to the receptionist. She looks at Sarah\'s name.</string>
    <string name="ch11ReceptionistKnowsMeAsSarah">\"Oh, Sarah Parson. You\'re from the news channel, right?\" the receptionist asks, excited.</string>
    <string name="ch11YeahINod">\"Yeah,\" I smile and nod.</string>
    <string name="ch11ReceptionistIsFanOfSarah">\"Oh, I should have recognized you right away! I\'m a big fan of yours. Can I have your autograph?\" the receptionist asks, handing me a notepad on the desk.</string>
    <string name="ch11LovelyFollower">\"Sure thing, lovely follower,\" I say to her. I sign \"Sarah Parson\", imitating Sarah\'s handwriting as well as I can.</string>
    <string name="ch11ReceptionistSwipesSarahsCard">\"Thanks,\" says the receptionist. She swipes Sarah\'s card and gives it back. I feel a bit bad, though. As it is, the real Sarah won\'t get to experience her high school reunion, and now, she\'s out some money, just because Yukio\'s being stubborn.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGetKeycard">\"Here is your second key, Ms. Parson,\" the receptionist says, handing me a keycard.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGoToEscalator">I go to Caitlyn and Yukio by the escalator. \"Yukio, I have your keycard,\" I say, to get his attention.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGiveYukioKeycard">Yukio turns around. \"Thank you,\" he says, taking his keycard. \"I must apologize for my behavior. I was working stressfully all this week, and I have been taking out the stress on you. It is not right.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11WhereDoWeEat">\"Whatever, Yukio,\" I say. I look at my clock. \"It\'s lunchtime. Where should we eat?\" I ask. Caitlyn and Yukio shrug. Well, I guess that it\'s up to me then. Like I said before, the Kenyon Imperial Hotel has several restaurants. Each one serves its own type of cuisine, and each one has a different price range.</string>
    <string name="ch11WeGoToHabitat">It\'s probably best just to get something that will hold me over until the reunion, something affordable. \"Let\'s go to The Habitat,\" I say to Caitlyn and Yukio. They agree, and we go.</string>
    <string name="ch11IAcceptYukiosApology">We walk through the hotel to get to The Habitat. I\'m walking beside Yukio, and I see him frowning. \"Hey, Yukio, I was just kidding,\" I say to him. \"I really do accept your apology.\" Yukio sighs.</string>
    <string name="ch11HostGreetsUs">We finally reach The Habitat, a rainforest-themed casual diner. \"Hello, welcome to The Habitat,\" says an employee in a safari outfit, as we come in.</string>
    <string name="ch11WeSitAtHabitat">The employee seats us at a table. We look through the menu. \"I might have a good-old cheeseburger,\" I say to Caitlyn and Yukio.</string>
    <string name="ch11INeedToWatchSarahsWeight">\"Kadey, you might want to watch Sarah\'s weight,\" reminds Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch11SarahWillBeFine">\"Nah, Sarah will be fine,\" I wink at Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch11YukioIsLuckyToBeWithUs">The server comes by. \"You must be lucky to be eating out with two fine ladies,\" he says to Yukio. The server takes our orders and leaves.</string>
    <string name="ch11IEatBurger">Sometime later, we get our food. My burger is nice and juicy. It even comes with thin-cut, fried potatoes. Yum! Oh, and coleslaw.</string>
    <string name="ch11HabitatDims">In the middle of eating my food, the lights in the restaurant dim out. What\'s going on? Is someone cutting the power?</string>
    <string name="ch11FakeThunder">Suddenly, the lights flash, accompanied by thunder on the loudspeaker.</string>
    <string name="ch11FakeMonkey">The loudspeaker then plays monkey sounds, \"Ooh ooh aah aah aah aah aah!\"</string>
    <string name="ch11HabitatIsLame">The lights finally brighten back to normal. Well, that was lame. I could barely even see my cheeseburger while that was happening.</string>
    <string name="ch11IFinishEating">We finish our food. We each pay for our own meals.</string>
    <string name="ch11WeGoUpstairs">We leave the restaurant and take the elevator up to our rooms.</string>
    <string name="ch11IEnterHotelRoom">\"I\'ll let you guys know when the event starts,\" I say to Caitlyn and Yukio. They go into their room. I look for my own keycard in my handbag.</string>
    <string name="ch11IExamineSarahsRoom">I look around Sarah\'s hotel room. It looks nice and tidy. I see luggage by the bed. It seems that Sarah was here earlier, before I possessed her.</string>
    <string name="ch11ICheckSarahsCloset">I look in the closet. A few of Sarah\'s outfits are hung.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWillExcercise">Hm … Caitlyn did ask me to watch Sarah\'s weight. Maybe I can make up for the cheeseburger by exercising. I know that this hotel has a workout center, so I can go there.</string>
    <string name="ch11IChangeIntoAthleticWear">I change out of my current clothes into a more athletic outfit.</string>
    <string name="ch11ILookAtHotelMirror">I end up wearing a lightweight sweatshirt, unzipped, over my undershirt. I\'m also wearing athletic shorts and running shoes. I look at myself in the mirror. I look just about ready, but I feel like I\'m forgetting something.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWorePonytailAsAnanya">Oh, that\'s right! When I was going to physical education class as Ananya, I tied my hair into a ponytail, so that my hair wouldn\'t get in the way. I should do that here, too.</string>
    <string name="ch11ITieSarahsHair">Done. I look in the mirror one more time. Yep, I\'m ready to go. I take Sarah\'s wallet and keycard out from her handbag and into the pocket of my sweatshirt, and then I head out.</string>
    <string name="ch11IKnockForCaitlyn">I stop by Yukio and Caitlyn\'s room, and knock on the door.</string>
    <string name="ch11CaitlynOpensDoor">Caitlyn opens the door. \"Hi there,\" she says.</string>
    <string name="ch11WillCaitlynExcerciseWithMe">\"Hi, Caitlyn. You said that I should maintain Sarah\'s weight earlier, so I\'m going down to the fitness center to work out. Do you want to come with me?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11CaitlynDoesNotExcerciseWithMe">\"Sorry, Kadey, but Yuki and I are busy right now. Still, it\'s nice of you to think about Sarah\'s health. You must really care about her,\" Caitlyn says. \"Take it easy,\" she says, hugging me.</string>
    <string name="ch11IEnterHealthClub">I take the elevator down to the Kenyon Imperial Hotel Health Club. I swipe my key through the card reader and head inside.</string>
    <string name="ch11ILookForTreadmill">There are other people inside. I see an unused treadmill and decide to use it.</string>
    <string name="ch11IRunOnTreadmill">I run on the treadmill, and I manage to keep a steady pace. Yeah, I\'m working off those 150 grams! I can even feel Sarah\'s average-strength muscles building up. This feels great! Now I know why it\'s a good idea to exercise every week.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGetOffTreadmill">Once I feel that I\'m done, I stop the treadmill and get off.</string>
    <string name="ch11GuestApproachesMe">I\'m about to leave, when another hotel guest approaches me.</string>
    <string name="ch11GuestFlirts">\"Oh, hey … I saw you running on the treadmill. You really seemed to be going at it. That kind of athleticism shouldn\'t go to waste.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11AmIGoodOrBad">The man walks towards me and backs me into a wall. \"I have a question. Are you a good girl, or are you a bad girl?\"</string>
    <string name="ch11GuestWastesMyTime">Ugh, this man is wasting my time. Should I play along anyway, or just leave him?</string>
    <string name="ch11ILeaveGuest">I decide to leave him.</string>
    <string name="ch11IAmGoodGirl">\"I\'m a good girl today. Sorry to disappoint you, creeper,\" I tell him.</string>
    <string name="ch11IPushGuest">I extend my tentacles from my back and push him away.</string>
    <string name="ch11GuestWillNotForget">The man falls to the floor. \"I won\'t forget this!\" he tells me.</string>
    <string name="ch11IPlayGuest">I decide to play along.</string>
    <string name="ch11IAmNaughtyFemale">\"Oh, yes, I am a naughty female,\" I say, smirking at him.</string>
    <string name="ch11GladToHearIt">\"Glad to hear it,\" he replies.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWrapGuest">\"In fact, I\'m so naughty, I can do this …\" I tell him, and I extend my tentacles from my back. I wrap my tentacles around him.</string>
    <string name="ch11WhatIsMyProblem">\"Agh!\" the man shouts. \"What\'s your problem, Lady?\" He pushes himself out of my tentacles and falls onto the floor.</string>
    <string name="ch11GuestAskedForIt">\"You asked for it,\" I say coldly.</string>
    <string name="ch11ILeaveHealthClub">Other people in the fitness center stare at us, confused. I walk out and head back to my room.</string>
    <string name="ch11IRelax">I sit on my bed and relax. It\'s midafternoon, and there\'s plenty of time to spare before the reunion late tonight. I\'m tired from working out, so I should stay here.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWillShower">I decide to take a shower.</string>
    <string name="ch11IShouldCool">I worked up quite a sweat, so it\'s reasonable that I cool off by showering.</string>
    <string name="ch11ILayNewClothes">I lay out some clean, new clothing on the bed, so that I have something to change into after I\'m done.</string>
    <string name="ch11IGetTowel">I pick out a towel, bring it into the bathroom, and lay it just outside the shower.</string>
    <string name="ch11IAdjustTemperature">I turn on the shower and adjust the temperature. Once the temperature is just right, I undress and walk in.</string>
    <string name="ch11IShower">Ah, these past few days have been hectic. A good shower helps me put everything back in focus. It\'s just me, alone with the running water. It\'s quiet and relaxing.</string>
    <string name="ch11IFeelGood">Heheh, who am I kidding? I feel goooooooood.</string>
    <string name="ch11IDry">After my shower, I dry myself off with the towel. I walk out to the bedroom.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWatchTV">I decide to watch television.</string>
    <string name="ch11NewNewsSegment">I turn on the television set in my room. It has the news channel. I watch a news segment done by another reporter.</string>
    <string name="ch11SeawallIntroduced">The reporter is standing outside. \"I\'m out on the coastline of New Ferando. Right now, we are standing on top of New Ferando\'s seawall, which keeps the Western Ocean separated from the city.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11CameraShowsSeawall">The camera moves to the edge of the seawall and points downwards.</string>
    <string name="ch11MayorIsCriticized">\"As you can see, the wall is in moderate disrepair. The mayor of New Ferando is being criticized for neglecting the safety of his citizens.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11Potholes">The video fades to prerecorded footage of cars driving on the road. \"The seawall is not the only safety concern for which the mayor has been criticized. New Ferando\'s busier roads, as well as its highway, have been reported to contain potholes,\" says a voiceover of the reporter.</string>
    <string name="ch11MayorsDefense">The footage then shows the mayor of New Ferando being interviewed outside the city hall. \"We make the most out of our budget,\" he says. \"We spend a fortune on education. We spend a fortune on healthcare and our hospitals. Ultimately, it is up to our prime minister in the mainland to give us an adequate budget to take care of these problems, and, in recent years, he has simply been unable to do so.\"</string>
    <string name="ch11ITurnOffTV">Eh, it\'s just politics. I turn off the television shortly afterwards.</string>
    <string name="ch11IWearFormalwear">I put on the formalwear that Sarah was going to wear to the reunion. Now that that is out of the way, I can take a nap and be ready to go to the reunion as soon as I wake up. I lie on top of my bed and go to sleep.</string>
    <string name="ch12Title">Chapter 12</string>
    <string name="ch12TimeAgo">10 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch12RebeccaAvoidedMe">Rebecca hadn\'t been meeting up with me for lunch at school as often as she used to. At first, I didn\'t think much about it. I just ate alone and then worked on my homework for the rest of the lunch period. A few weeks passed, and, well, I got curious about what was going on with Rebecca.</string>
    <string name="ch12ISpiedOnRebecca">One weekend, I took my binoculars and entered the building across the street from our apartment building. I went up to the roof.</string>
    <string name="ch12ISawIntoRebeccaRoom">From there, I looked into Rebecca\'s room. It was dim, but from what I was able to make out, Rebecca was sitting on her bed with another person, and they were looking into each other\'s eyes. Then, the other person reached towards Rebecca, and …</string>
    <string name="ch12DidRebeccaLoseInterest">… And … well … I just felt too nervous. I lowered my binoculars, and I was a bit confused. I understood that Rebecca enjoyed being with her other friends, but … why this? What was wrong with me that had Rebecca lose interest?</string>
    <string name="ch12MyHeartStopped">Just that moment, my heart felt like it stopped. I had just realized what was going on, but I had to make sure.</string>
    <string name="ch12ICaughtRebecca">The following week, I met up with Rebecca at school. \"Rebecca! I … we … we haven\'t really talked to each other these past few weeks. I mean … I\'m sure you\'re okay, but … uh …\" I started to nervously stutter.</string>
    <string name="ch12RebeccaWasUncomfortable">At first, Rebecca looked puzzled, but then she looked down and sighed. \"Alex … you\'ve been giving me a lot of attention lately. I just needed some space. Look, I …\" She swore under her breath. \"… We\'ve been good friends and everything, but … you\'ve just been a bit too controlling. I mean, I get it. You\'re the socially-awkward geek, and you probably mean well by all of this, but … I just don\'t think I\'m the right girl for you. If you could be in my shoes, you\'d understand.\"</string>
    <string name="ch12ILeftRebeccaAlone">I looked down for a moment too, staring blankly at the ground. \"And Alex …\" I look back up. \"… please, for the rest of the school year, let me be by myself. Thanks,\" she said softly. I nodded and walked away.</string>
    <string name="ch13Title">Chapter 13</string>
    <string name="ch13IAwaken">I wake up from my nap. I\'m still alone in my room. I look at the clock. I have about half an hour before the reunion starts.</string>
    <string name="ch13IPace">I get up and pace around my room. Hm, what else can I do to prepare for the reunion? Well, if I stay as Sarah, maybe I should access some more of her memories. It might help me stay in character during the event.</string>
    <string name="ch13IConcentrate">I start to concentrate. Ergh! It\'s making my head hurt. I need to stop thinking.</string>
    <string name="ch13IClearMyMind">I stop, clear my mind, and take some deep breaths. I start to feel better.</string>
    <string name="ch13RebeccaAppears">I turn around and see Rebecca sitting on my bed. \"I\'m glad we met,\" she says.</string>
    <string name="ch13IsRebeccaVaNal">\"How did you get in here? Are you Va\'Nal again?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch13RebeccaHasNoPlaceForMe">Rebecca ignores what I said. \"I remember when I first met him. I was young then. I thought I could open up to him. For all of those years, he acted like a friend, but I was wrong about him. He didn\'t actually care,\" Rebecca sniffles. She looks up at me, \"Then, I met you. You reminded me what true friendship was. You let me realize that he had no place in my life. You let me realize that I didn\'t really need a boyfriend.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13StopItRebecca">\"Rebecca, come on. Don\'t talk like that,\" I say nervously.</string>
    <string name="ch13RebeccaVanishes">I walk towards her and reach out, but she vanishes. Oh, what\'s going on?</string>
    <string name="ch13IWashMyFace">I go to the bathroom sink and splash water on my face. I look at Sarah\'s reflection again. I feel a little bit better.</string>
    <string name="ch13IGetCaitlynAndYukio">I leave my room and go to the door of Yukio and Caitlyn\'s room. I knock. They answer, and I tell them that I\'m ready to go.</string>
    <string name="ch13WeWalkToBallroom">We walk through the halls of the hotel on our way to the ballroom. This is it! It\'s been years since I\'ve seen Rebecca! What am I going to say to her? What would Sarah say to her?</string>
    <string name="ch13IFeelLightheaded">I start to feel lightheaded.</string>
    <string name="ch13ILeanOnWall">I tell Caitlyn and Yukio that I need to stop and lean on the wall for a moment. I take more deep breaths.</string>
    <string name="ch13AnxietyAttack">Tentacles come out of my back. Now what\'s happening? Am I losing control of my powers? It must be the anxiety. Why am I so worried? Rebecca won\'t see me anyway, when I talk to her. She\'ll see Sarah.</string>
    <string name="ch13IAmAMonster">I look at my tentacles again. Ah, who am I kidding? She won\'t see Sarah either. She\'ll see a monster.</string>
    <string name="ch13IShouldNotGo">Caitlyn stares silently in shock at me. Yukio asks, \"Kaden, what is going on? You look unwell. Perhaps you should not go to this event, until you have calmed down.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13IHaveToGo">\"I have to go!\" I shout.</string>
    <string name="ch13YukioIsRight">I have a lot going through my head right now. Still, Yukio has a point. \"You\'re right, Yukio,\" I say. \"I just need a moment to calm down. Stay here. I\'ll be back in a couple of minutes.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13IGoToBalcony">I walk to a nearby balcony outside. I see the view of the city in front of me. It\'s still raining. The sky is grey, like it always is this time of year.</string>
    <string name="ch13AmIUpset">\"Are you upset?\" a voice asks behind me. I turn around.</string>
    <string name="ch13IWasNeverTheProblem">\"We got off on the wrong foot, didn\'t we?\" remarks Baqer. \"I was getting all mad at you, and for what? It turns out you weren\'t the problem in the first place.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13WeKnowRealProblem">Baqer leans on the balcony\'s rail, looks at me, narrows his eyes, and smirks. \"We both know who the real problem is, don\'t we?\"</string>
    <string name="ch13RebeccaMadeMeBad">\"That Rebecca girl. What happened with her? For nearly six years, you treated her right. You were there for her, weren\'t you? Those years go by. You\'re near the end of high school. You wait for her to repay you, but what does she do? She doubts. She changes her mind. She backs out. And what\'s the worst part? She makes you the bad guy.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13TooLateForRebecca">Baqer looks out to the city. \"Go to the reunion, if you want. Let\'s be honest, though. Even if the girl is there, what\'s the point? Even if she apologizes, what\'s the point? It\'s too late for that. She wasn\'t there when you needed her the most. Getting through to her is a lost cause,\" Baqer says, shaking his head.</string>
    <string name="ch13RebeccaWasNotThere">\"You\'re right. She wasn\'t there,\" I admit.</string>
    <string name="ch13BaqerIsGloomy">\"Aw, don\'t be all gloom and doom, Brother,\" says another voice behind us. It\'s Sezja.</string>
    <string name="ch13ICanBeAnyoneIWant">\"Don\'t listen to him, Best Friend,\" Sezja says to me. \"Think about the powers our brother Bek\'Shtii has given you. You can be with anyone you want. You can be anyone you want.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13ILookWonderful">Sezja looks me over. \"Oh, you look wonderful! Stop doubting yourself, Friend. Go to that reunion and be the person she wants you to be.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13BeWhomRebeccaWants">\"Be who she wants?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch13GodsGaveInput">\"My brothers have given their input,\" a third voice says. It\'s Bek\'Shtii.</string>
    <string name="ch13CoworkersWillDoubt">\"Do not let them waste any more of your time. Your coworkers wait for you back inside. The longer that you take, the more they will doubt you. You already know, firsthand, what happens when others doubt you.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13BekShtiiIsDoubted">\"The False Spirit isn\'t the only person being doubted right now,\" Baqer says to Bek\'Shtii. Bek\'Shtii sighs and turns back to me, \"I only say these things for your own good. Now, go.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13YeahYeahOKISay">\"Yeah, yeah, okay,\" I say, and I leave the balcony.</string>
    <string name="ch13IEncounterOfficer">I head back to where Caitlyn and Yukio were. When I reach them, I see a police officer standing beside them.</string>
    <string name="ch13PoliceReceivedComplaint">\"Hello, Sarah Parson. We were looking for you. One of the hotel guests complained that a woman with tentacles attacked him.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13OhReallyIAsk">\"Oh, really?\" I ask sarcastically.</string>
    <string name="ch13DidIDealWithScientists">\"Miss Parson, I do believe that you interviewed a park ranger about a man who shapeshifted into a dark figure with glowing red eyes. And, the day before, you interviewed another police officer about that same dark figure with red eyes. I always thought you were the deceptive type, Miss Parson. Tell me, what do you know about this dark phantom? Did you make a deal with those mad scientists up in the mountains?\"</string>
    <string name="ch13HotScoop">The officer turns to Caitlyn and Yukio and looks back at me. \"Ah, that would explain it,\" he says. \"Maybe you are the phantom who attacked my coworker earlier this week. Why did you do it, Young Lady? Did you want even more fame? Was being a successful journalist not good enough for you? I bet you wanted a big story that would push you to the top! You wanted a hit so bad, you went to these mad scientists to make you one of these phantom-things so that you would be the talk of the town, so that you would be your own hot scoop.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13HotScoopInJail">\"Well, let me make it clear, Miss Parson, you\'ll get your hot scoop … in jail!\"</string>
    <string name="ch13OfficerIsAboutToShockMe">The officer raises an electroshock pistol at me.</string>
    <string name="ch13ICounterOfficer">I extend my tentacles and push his arm up just as he\'s about to electrocute me. \"Okay, one, I\'m not really Sarah Parson. Two, you should watch your attitude, Officer,\" I taunt him.</string>
    <string name="ch13OfficerSummonsAgent">\"Oh, you\'re not getting away, whoever you are. Agent, get this thing!\" the officer shouts.</string>
    <string name="ch13IAmVacuumed">A man with a vacuum device on his back enters the hall. He nods at the officer, and the man points the hose of the device at me. I get separated from Sarah\'s body, and I get sucked into the device. \"I knew that our country\'s Bureau of Paranormal Investigations would be useful,\" the officer chuckles.</string>
    <string name="ch13ItIsDark">It\'s so dark in here. I can\'t see anything. I hear the officer\'s voice. \"Ma\'am, you need to stay put! This is official business.\"</string>
    <string name="ch13TheyTakeMeAway">\"Kadey, don\'t let them take you away!\" says Caitlyn\'s voice.</string>
    <string name="ch13DoNotRevealMyRealName">\"Don\'t let them know my real name. Sheesh,\" I say to Caitlyn.</string>
    <string name="ch13KatieIsEmbarrassing">\"Katie? Your name is \'Katie\'? That\'s embarrassing for a menace like yourself! No wonder why you don\'t want us to know,\" the officer laughs.</string>
    <string name="ch13KatieFoolsThem">\"Uh, yeah, that\'s right. My name is \'Katie\'. Darn, well, I guess you got me now,\" I tell the officer.</string>
    <string name="ch13LaughingFades">The officer keeps laughing. The laughing fades away. Then, I hear nothing, and my consciousness fades.</string>
    <string name="ch14Title">Chapter 14</string>
    <string name="ch14TimeAgo">500 years ago …</string>
    <string name="ch14ItWasDusk">It was a warm and bloody dusk.</string>
    <string name="ch14ArmyMarched">Nearly a thousand men of the mainland marched their way to the sacred pyramid.</string>
    <string name="ch14MenCarriedTorches">Some men carried torches.</string>
    <string name="ch14MenCarriedFirearms">Others carried firearms.</string>
    <string name="ch14NativesFled">As the mainland army continued to march, the surviving natives fled in terror.</string>
    <string name="ch14ArmyReachedPyramid">The army finally reached the base of the pyramid.</string>
    <string name="ch14PhantomArose">Before the men could walk the pyramid\'s steps, a large figure arose from the top.</string>
    <string name="ch14ElFantasma">The figure towered over the mainlanders. They looked up and pointed at it. \"¡El fantasma! ¡El fantasma!\" they cried.</string>
    <string name="ch15Title">Chapter 15</string>
    <string name="ch15IAmInJail">I awaken in my gaseous form. I\'m in a glass tube, about the size of a person. Just outside the tube are the confines of a jail cell.</string>
    <string name="ch15ISeeViolinist">I hear somber music. I turn around and see a prisoner in another cell playing a violin. He looks down at the ground while playing, deprived of any hope.</string>
    <string name="ch15ISeeBeggar">I turn around again and see another prisoner shaking a can of coins. \"Spare change, Sir?\" the prisoner asks, looking up at a passing jailer.</string>
    <string name="ch15ISeeAddict">I look at one final prisoner, who\'s in a cell right next to me. He\'s breathing from a large inhaling device.</string>
    <string name="ch15AddictTalks">He notices me and turns his head. \"Hey Man, didn\'t notice you until now. Wow, I\'ve seen some pretty gnarly stuff before, but you\'re the real deal, aren\'t you? What are you anyway, and what did you get busted for?\"</string>
    <string name="ch15SoundproofTube">I can\'t respond to him. My tube must be soundproof.</string>
    <string name="ch15LittleBuddyCannotTalk">\"Can\'t talk, Little Buddy? No probs. I\'ll just be chilling here.\"</string>
    <string name="ch15IHaveCivilRights">Shortly afterwards, the prisoners fall asleep. I look up at the small window in my cell. It\'s overcast and raining. It doesn\'t matter, though. I can\'t do anything in this tube. The police department doesn\'t think that they can keep me in this tube, do they? I have civil rights!</string>
    <string name="ch15BallBreaksMyCell">A wrecking ball crashes through the back wall of my cell and breaks my tube. I fly out of the broken tube and reform into my physical body.</string>
    <string name="ch15ConstructorGreetsMe">Outside, I see a construction worker inside the cabin of a crane. The worker steps out of the cabin and waves his arms. \"Hey, Best Friend, I set you free!\"</string>
    <string name="ch15ConstructorIsDispossessed">Suddenly, a figure jumps out from the construction worker\'s body. The figure lands in front of the worker.</string>
    <string name="ch15ItsSezja">It\'s Sezja!</string>
    <string name="ch15SezjaIsHappySeeingMe">\"I felt so bad when those guys locked you up! I\'m glad you\'re okay.\"</string>
    <string name="ch15HowLongWasIJailed">\"Thanks, Sezja,\" I say. \"How long have I been in there?\"</string>
    <string name="ch15ItIsMorning">\"You\'ve been in there overnight. This is actually morning, but I guess it\'s hard to tell with this rain,\" Sezja says, \"But a lot has happened! Look around!\"</string>
    <string name="ch15ILookAround">I do look around.</string>
    <string name="ch15OhWow">Oh … wow …</string>
    <string name="ch15FloodedRoads">The roads nearby are all flooded.</string>
    <string name="ch15BekShtiiAndBaqerFight">\"While you were in jail, my two brothers started fighting,\" Sezja explains. \"All this time, we have been wanting you to bring the change that our continent sorely needs. When you got captured, my brothers decided to take matters into their own hands and bring that change themselves. Bek\'Shtii has changed into a large phantom and has flooded half of the city, hoping to erase the existing life and to begin anew. Baqer, on the other hand, just wants to destroy everything. Baqer split himself into hundreds of fire spirits and is terrorizing the other half of the city.\"</string>
    <string name="ch15CanBaqerTurnIntoFireSpirits">\"Wait, hold on. Baqer turned himself into hundreds of fire spirits? I … didn\'t know that he could do that,\" I tell Sezja.</string>
    <string name="ch15DoIDislikeHistory">\"I guess you\'re not into history, are you?\" Sezja laughs. \"Maybe when we were those students, I should\'ve been someone who had history class with you. Then, I could have helped you learn all the good stuff,\" he adds.</string>
    <string name="ch15DidSezjaEnjoySchool">\"You really enjoyed being at that school, didn\'t you?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch15ThereIsCamp">\"Yup,\" he says, rubbing the back of his head. He sighs, \"I guess this isn\'t a good time to be cheerful. Hundreds of thousands of lives are at risk.\" Sezja frowns. \"Listen, there\'s an evacuation camp at the airport, at the top of the New Ferando Hill. Find your friends and take them to the camp. I\'m sure the government will fly you out of this place. I don\'t know if I\'ll ever see you again.\"</string>
    <string name="ch15SezjaHugs">Sezja hugs me. \"This is it, Good Buddy,\" he says.</string>
    <string name="ch15SezjaPaddles">Sezja walks away to the flooded roads. He takes off his mask and sets it on the water. He sits on the mask, like a raft, and paddles away.</string>
    <string name="ch15MeAndCity">So this is it, then. It\'s me and the city. I watch as the flood rises and some of the weaker buildings begin to crumble. I need to act now.</string>
    <string name="ch15ILookAtConstructor">I look at the construction worker that Sezja had possessed just moments ago.</string>
    <string name="ch15IPossessConstructor">He might be useful, so I possess him.</string>
    <string name="ch15MyTeethAreBad">Yuck! My mouth feels odd. My teeth feel like they\'re rotting, and at least one tooth must be missing altogether. Oh well. Dental hygiene isn\'t important when I need to save the world.</string>
    <string name="ch15IClimbBuilding">I extend my tentacles and climb up a nearby tall building.</string>
    <string name="ch15ISeeRestOfCity">At the top, I get a better view of the city. Wow, Sezja was right. The flood really does cover half the city, and I can see some buildings far away, on the other side of the city, on fire. Fortunately, the rain does seem to keep the fire contained, but the fire is still there. It\'s not like the rain is going to stop the flood, either.</string>
    <string name="ch15IFindConstructionSite">I need a weapon. I look around and find a construction site, which seems to have been recently abandoned.</string>
    <string name="ch15IJumpToConstructionSite">I jump down to it, using my tentacles to cushion my landing.</string>
    <string name="ch15IGetPickaxe">I search for anything useful around the construction site. I find a pickaxe. Perfect. I take the pickaxe and continue on.</string>
    <string name="ch15IJumpBetweenRooftops">I climb up another building and start leaping from rooftop to rooftop.</string>
    <string name="ch15PeopleBelowTrapped">I occasionally look down at the streets below. There are still plenty of people left in the city, who haven\'t evacuated. Most of them are trapped on a small patch of land, with the rest of the ground around them submerged in water.</string>
    <string name="ch15IFindFireSpirits">I keep going, and I eventually see a group of fire spirits down below causing mischief. I jump down and confront them.</string>
    <string name="ch15SpiritsSurroundMe">The fire spirits take notice and surround me. They grin and rub their hands together.</string>
    <string name="ch15ISlamSpirits">I clench my pickaxe. The spirits step towards me. I grab them with my tentacles and slam them to the ground.</string>
    <string name="ch15IDeathByOverconfidence">I stand over one of them. \"Don\'t overestimate yourself, Baqer! Remember, two out of five deaths are due to over-confidence,\" I say, spitting through my missing tooth. The fire spirit gasps.</string>
    <string name="ch15KeptYouWaiting">I stand over one of them. \"I kept you waiting, huh, Baqer,\" I say, spitting through my missing tooth. The fire spirit gasps.</string>
    <string name="ch15IStrikeSpirit">I strike my pickaxe down on the spirit. The fire spirit crumbles into a pile of hot ash. I make quick work of the other fire spirits, as well.</string>
    <string name="ch15ILeaveSpirits">I get back onto the rooftops and keep going.</string>
    <string name="ch15SchoolBusNeedsHelp">\"Help, help! Is anyone there? Help!\" I hear a voice say, down below. It\'s coming from a school bus, trapped on a sunken road.</string>
    <string name="ch15IDispossessConstructor">I land near the school bus and dispossess the construction worker. \"I\'m here! I\'ll help you!\" I shout.</string>
    <string name="ch15IAmHero">The students on the bus turn around and cheer. \"Hey, isn\'t that the phantom guy on TV?\" one student asks. \"Maybe. He sure is a hero!\" says another student.</string>
    <string name="ch15ILiftBus">I use my tentacles to lift the bus out of the water and onto dry road.</string>
    <string name="ch15StudentsThankMe">The students and the bus driver come out through the emergency back door. \"Thanks, Mr. Phantom!\" the students say. Among them are Élodie, Carleigh, and Hewitt. \"Hey, you look familiar. You\'re Élodie, aren\'t you?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch15IKnowElodie">\"You know me?\" Élodie asks.</string>
    <string name="ch15KeepFriendsClose">\"I do. It\'s a long story, though,\" I reply. \"Hewitt and Carleigh are your friends, aren\'t they?\" I nod over to them. \"Keep them close to you. I learnt that about my friends the hard way,\" I admit to her.</string>
    <string name="ch15ICanSayEllie">\"Okay, if you say so, Mr.\" Élodie nods. \"Also, you can call me \'Ellie\'.\"</string>
    <string name="ch15KeepStudentsSafe">\"Okay, Ellie,\" I say, \"keep yourself and your schoolmates safe!\"</string>
    <string name="ch15WowStudentsSay">I fly up into the air and over the buildings. \"Wow!\" I hear the students say in the distance.</string>
    <string name="ch15PhantomGoesToHotel">Not too far away, I see a large, black, ghostly figure walking towards the Kenyon Imperial Hotel.</string>
    <string name="ch15IsThatBekShtii">Is that Bek\'Shtii?</string>
    <string name="ch15WhatIsBekShtiiDoing">I fly over to the large figure. \"Bek\'Shtii! Bek\'Shtii! Is that you? What are you doing?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch15ModernSelfishness">The ghostly figure turns around, his eyes glowing a bright yellow. \"Do not interfere, Dr. Kaden,\" says Bek\'Shtii. \"Five hundred years ago, I had lost my loyal, loving followers. In the wake of their passing, I have since watched over this continent. I have seen the changes through which the western continent underwent. It is clear now what has become of modern society. You are a selfish, despicable lot. Undisciplined, uncaring, unfaithful. The past was a better time, and I will gladly recreate its glory, if I must.\"</string>
    <string name="ch15IHoldBekShtiiBack">\"Yeah, well, that doesn\'t help me,\" I tell Bek\'Shtii. I reach out for Bek\'Shtii with my tentacles and try to hold him back from reaching the hotel.</string>
    <string name="ch15BekShtiiThrowsMe">Bek\'Shtii picks me up and throws me several city blocks away. I hit the wall of a building hard and fall into the floodwater below.</string>
    <string name="ch15IDrift">I\'m dizzy and weak. I look up at the grey sky. The flow of the water is carrying me away. Away from Bek\'Shtii. Away from the hotel.</string>
    <string name="ch15IShouldHaveBeenAtReunion">This wasn\'t supposed to happen. I should have been at the reunion. I could have seen all of those familiar faces. I could have socialized and have had fun, but no. No, now the city of New Ferando is flooded. Now there are people who need to be rescued. And now, I\'m too weak to even help anymore.</string>
    <string name="ch15IWillBeRescued">Everything around me gets quieter. Maybe, in a little while, I\'ll wash up on dry land. The government will find me and rescue me, and who knows what they\'ll do next. All I know is that, for now, this phantom has done all that he can. I close my eyes and let myself drift away.</string>
    <string name="ch16Title">Chapter 16</string>
    <string name="ch16DoIGiveUp">\"So, are you giving up?\" I hear Va\'Nal\'s voice echo in my head.</string>
    <string name="ch16HerBrotherWon">\"Yeah … I guess I am. Your brother won. Didn\'t you want that?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch16WhyAreGodsHere">\"Kaden, think about what has happened to you. Why do you think that we are here?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16IDrankBekShtiisBlood">\"You\'re all here because I drank your brother\'s blood, right?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16IsThatReallyWhy">\"Are you sure that that is the real reason?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16SezjaSaidSo">\"Well, sure. Sezja said so when I first met him.\"</string>
    <string name="ch16WhatDoIDream">\"And what do you dream about?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16VaNalKnows">\"You know what I dream about.\"</string>
    <string name="ch16WhyDoIKeepDreaming">\"I do know. Why do you keep dreaming about her?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16SenseStopped">\"I don\'t know. I guess … I guess things just stopped making sense when she left. I really wasn\'t sure what I wanted to do. I wasn\'t sure who I wanted to be.\"</string>
    <string name="ch16HowWouldSheFeelAtReunion">\"Tell me, Kaden. If she saw you, the real you, at the reunion, and found out how you feel, how do you think she would feel?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16ImNotSure">\"I\'m … I\'m not sure.\"</string>
    <string name="ch16DoINotRemember">\"Do you not remember?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16RememberWhat">\"Remember what?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16TimeAgo">\"Six years ago.\"</string>
    <string name="ch16WhatTimeAgo">\"Six years ago?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16IWasAtAirport">\"Oh, yeah, I was at the airport. I had finished my undergraduate program at Éclair and had come back home not too long ago, and Rebecca\'s family invited me to say farewell to them. They were moving to the mainland.\"</string>
    <string name="ch16WhatDidRebeccaSay">\"And what did Rebecca say to you?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16LongTimeNoSee">\"She said, \'Alex, long time no see.\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch16WhatDidSheSayAfter">\"And what did she say after that?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16NoHurtFeelings">\"She said, \'The last time we met, we weren\'t getting along with each other. I didn\'t want that to happen, though. I think part of it was my fault. I didn\'t want to hurt your feelings, so I didn\'t say how I had moved on from you. Then, when I did, it was too late.\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch16WhatDidYouSay">\"And what did you say?\"</string>
    <string name="ch16IAmStillBadWithPeople">\"\'I\'m sorry too, Rebecca. I didn\'t want to be hard on you, either. I guess I\'m still not good with other people.\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch16BeSuccessful">\"Then, she said, \'Don\'t say that, Alex. I\'m sure there are plenty of things that you are good at. I want you to be successful. I want you to be happy. Just, without me.\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch16FindSomeoneElse">\"Then, she said, \'Don\'t say that, Alex. I want you to be happy with other people. I want you to find someone who means a lot to you. Just, not me.\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch16DoThatOK">\"\'Do that, for me, okay?\'\"</string>
    <string name="ch16RebeccaAndIHugged">\"After that, Rebecca and I hugged, Rebecca and her family left on the airplane, and I went my own way.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17Title">Chapter 17</string>
    <string name="ch17IOpenEyes">I open my eyes.</string>
    <string name="ch17IAmOnMainAve">I\'ve washed up on Main Avenue. Rows of tall buildings line the road.</string>
    <string name="ch17RainStops">The rain has stopped. Abandoned cars are scattered among the road. All is quiet.</string>
    <string name="ch17AveIsEmpty">No one\'s here. Everybody must be at the airport now, off to the northwest. Either that, or they\'re trapped elsewhere.</string>
    <string name="ch17DrKaden">\"Dr. Kaden?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17VaNalIsBehindMe">I turn around. Va\'Nal is there.</string>
    <string name="ch17DoITrulyKnowVaNal">\"Do you know who we truly are, by now?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17IKnowVaNal">\"Yeah … I do know,\" I tell her.</string>
    <string name="ch17INeglectedVaNal">Va\'Nal nods. \"Ten years. You have neglected me for ten years. Why?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17IAssumedEmpathyVaNal">\"I assumed that however I felt, everyone else would feel the same way. It even seemed that way too, at first. I didn\'t understand what went wrong.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17ILostTrustVaNal">\"After things did go wrong, I felt that tending to romance was hopeless. After all, if I could not keep the trust of someone I knew since middle school, what chance would I have with someone who would not even know me until later? So I neglected that feeling.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17IShouldHaveCared">\"I kept focusing on all these other people, but, in the end, I was really more concerned with controlling them, rather than caring for them, wasn\'t I?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17VaNalAsksWereYou">\"Were you?\" Va\'Nal asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17RebeccaWantsMeToAcceptVaNal">\"Kaden, more than 500 years ago, our people realized that, in order to live a fulfilling life, they needed to balance several aspects of humanity. Neglecting one aspect, even if it were for the favor of another, would result in depression. I am one of such. Rebecca wants you to accept me again, as do I.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17VaNalHoldsHands">Va\'Nal holds my hands. \"Kaden, my brothers will keep fighting unless you restore that balance. Please, let me be a part of you once more.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17ILeanIntoVaNal">I nod and lean towards her.</string>
    <string name="ch17VaNalAbsorbsMe">I feel myself absorbed into her.</string>
    <string name="ch17IMergedWithVaNal">I look at my hands. They are Va\'Nal\'s. I can feel the plantlike texture of my skin.</string>
    <string name="ch17VaNalsSkinChanges">Moments later, however, that changes. I feel a dull pain throughout my body. I watch as my leafy skin softens into normal flesh.</string>
    <string name="ch17IWalkToShop">There\'s a shop nearby. I walk over to it. I look at my reflection in the display window.</string>
    <string name="ch17IExamineVaNal">I see that not only has my skin changed, but so has my hair. I practically look like a human version of Va\'Nal. Is this really the new me?</string>
    <string name="ch17HelicoptersFlyAbove">Rescue helicopters fly above me.</string>
    <string name="ch17IClimbBuildingAsVaNal">I extend my tentacles from my back, a skill which I luckily still have. I use them to climb the nearby building, to see where those helicopters are headed.</string>
    <string name="ch17HelicoptersFlyToCamp">Sure enough, the helicopters fly to New Ferando Airport to pick up the displaced citizens.</string>
    <string name="ch17IOverlookCamp">I move to a building directly overlooking the airport. I notice that the citizens are happy to see the helicopters, knowing that they will be safe in the mainland.</string>
    <string name="ch17SavedCitizensMakesMeHappy">Seeing the citizens like this makes me happy, too.</string>
    <string name="ch17ISeemPleasant">\"You seem … pleasant.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17OtherGodsBehindMe">I turn around and see the other native gods.</string>
    <string name="ch17IJoinKinship">\"Welcome to our kinship, New Sister,\" smiles Bek\'Shtii, now back in his normal form.</string>
    <string name="ch17SezjaLovesMe">\"Yay! I thought we were done for, but you saved us! I love you, Best Sis, and I\'m going to keep loving you, like any good brother should,\" Sezja squees.</string>
    <string name="ch17SezjaHugsMe">He runs towards me and hugs me, squeezing my chest in the process. Seriously, he\'s squeezing my chest. It even hurts more this time, too.</string>
    <string name="ch17HeartyFeast">\"Well, it looks like we\'re all a big, happy family now,\" Baqer comments. \"How about we celebrate by having a nice, hearty feast, back home?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17LetUsEat">\"Yeah, you bet!\" we all say.</string>
    <string name="ch17IExamineMyselfAsPhantom">I see my black, vaporous face. I see my red, glowing eyes. I obviously didn\'t always look like this, but does it matter at this point? This is me now. This is the path in which I\'m heading. For better or worse, this really is me.</string>
    <string name="ch17BekShtiiIsBehindMe">I turn around. Bek\'Shtii is there, back in his normal form.</string>
    <string name="ch17DoITrulyKnowBekShtii">\"By now, may I assume that you know who we truly are?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17IKnowBekShtii">\"Yeah … I do know,\" I tell him.</string>
    <string name="ch17IHeldBekShtii">Bek\'Shtii nods. \"Fifteen years. You have held onto me for fifteen years. Why?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17IAssumedEmpathyBekShtii">\"I assumed that however I felt, everyone else would feel the same way. It even seemed that way too, at first. I kept holding onto the past, because I didn\'t understand what went wrong.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17ILostTrustBekShtii">\"After things did go wrong, I felt that continuing on was hopeless. After all, if I could not keep the trust of someone I knew since middle school, what chance would I have with someone who would not even know me until later?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17IShouldHaveWorriedAboutMyself">\"I kept focusing on all these other people, but, in the end, I really should have been worrying about myself, shouldn\'t I?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17BekShtiiAsksShouldYou">\"Should you have?\" Bek\'Shtii asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17RebeccaWantsMeToReleaseBekShtii">\"Kaden, more than 500 years ago, my people realized that, in order to live a fulfilling life, they needed to balance several aspects of humanity. Neglecting one aspect, even if it were for the favor of another, would result in depression. I am only one of several. Rebecca wants you to let go of me, as do I.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17BekShtiiGivesMeDagger">Bek\'Shtii reaches into his waistcoat and pulls out a dagger. He hands it to me. \"You know what you have to do,\" he whispers.</string>
    <string name="ch17IStabBekShtii">I nod. I hold onto his shoulder, and stab him in the heart.</string>
    <string name="ch17BekShtiiBleeds">Blood drips from Bek\'Shtii\'s mouth. \"Thank you,\" he says.</string>
    <string name="ch17IAbsorbBekShtii">Bek\'Shtii dissolves into a black vapor, which gets absorbed into me.</string>
    <string name="ch17IShake">I can feel his power. My body shakes, overwhelmed.</string>
    <string name="ch17IKnowWhatToDo">I know what I have to do now.</string>
    <string name="ch17IShootTentacles">Tentacles shoot out from my body. From my back, from my face, from my arms.</string>
    <string name="ch17TentaclesRise">They rise up into the sky …</string>
    <string name="ch17TheyPossessCitizens">… and fall into the citizens at the evacuation camp.</string>
    <string name="ch17Dozens">I possess dozens of citizens.</string>
    <string name="ch17Hundreds">Hundreds.</string>
    <string name="ch17Thousands">Thousands.</string>
    <string name="ch17TenThousands">Tens of thousands.</string>
    <string name="ch17HundredThousands">Hundreds of thousands.</string>
    <string name="ch17IReadEveryone">I can see through their eyes. I can read their thoughts. Each person has their own memories and ambitions.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeMarchIntoCity">As the citizens of New Ferando, we march out of the evacuation camp and into the city proper. It is time to show these people the gift of a phantom.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeRestoreCity">Within days, we will have restored New Ferando to working order.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeExtinguishFire">We extinguish the fire.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeDrainFlood">I absorb the knowledge of the engineers, and we drain the flood.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeRepairBuildings">We repair the buildings that were damaged.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeCelebrate">We\'re finally done. We cheer and celebrate. Once the rest of the world finds out what happened here, they, too, will find the future that I have shaped. They, too, will appreciate the powers of a phantom.</string>
    <string name="ch17IExamineMyRealSelf">I see my old, familiar face. I see my hood, casting a shadow over my eyes.</string>
    <string name="ch17PhantomFirstDefinition">\"Phantom.\" Literally, it means \"ghost\" or \"spirit\".</string>
    <string name="ch17PhantomSecondDefinition">But … it can also mean \"elusive\" or \"mysterious\". That\'s how I\'ve been. I\'ve kept to myself for a long time, but can I really go on like this forever?</string>
    <string name="ch17IAssumedEmpathySelf">I had been so selfish in the past. I assumed that however I felt, everyone else would feel the same way. It even seemed that way too, at first. I didn\'t understand what went wrong.</string>
    <string name="ch17ILostTrustSelf">After things did go wrong, I felt that continuing on was hopeless. After all, if I could not keep the trust of someone I knew since middle school, what chance would I have with someone who would not even know me until later?</string>
    <string name="ch17WhyICreatedTheGods">I remember that lecture from Prof. Arvin\'s class. He said that the western natives realized that, in order to live a fulfilling life, they needed to balance several aspects of humanity. Neglecting one aspect, even if it were for the favor of another, would result in depression. Their gods personified these aspects. Not everyone believed in the gods, but it did not matter, because their principles were real.</string>
    <string name="ch17ICanStillLove">I was being too cynical the whole time. I realize now that there is still love to be had.</string>
    <string name="ch17IGrabMyHood">I reach for my hood. My hands tremble. I have to let go of the past. I cannot be a stranger anymore.</string>
    <string name="ch17ILowerMyHood">I slowly pull down my hood. I look at my reflection once more. I shiver.</string>
    <string name="ch17ThisIsRealMe">This is me. This is who I have always been, underneath. For better or worse, this really is me.</string>
    <string name="ch17IClimbToSeeHotel">I climb up a tall building. I look over in the distance, to the Kenyon Imperial Hotel. I have one thing left to do.</string>
    <string name="ch17IGoToHotel">I make my way to the hotel. Below, I notice that the floodwater is surrounding the hotel, keeping people trapped inside.</string>
    <string name="ch17HotelFloods">Just then, someone shatters the glass doors of the hotel entrance. The flood flows into the hotel lobby, lowering to ankle height. Hundreds of guests run out of the hotel, some of them pushing other guests away.</string>
    <string name="ch17ManShovesLady">\"Out of the way, Lady!\" I hear a man yell. I look to see where the voice was coming from.</string>
    <string name="ch17CaitlynKneels">I see Caitlyn kneeling on the ground. \"Caitlyn!\" I shout.</string>
    <string name="ch17IGoToCaitlyn">I land on the ground, next to her. \"Kaden, you came back?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17YukioComes">\"Caitlyn!\" Yukio says, catching up to us.</string>
    <string name="ch17TideApproachesCaitlyn">\"Looks like all three of us are here,\" I smile. I look in the distance and see a tidal wave coming towards us.</string>
    <string name="ch17ISaveCaitlyn">\"Hang on tight. I\'m bringing us to the evacuation camp,\" I say. I hold onto Caitlyn and Yukio with my tentacles and climb back up.</string>
    <string name="ch17CaitlynAsksAboutFlood">I leap between rooftops to reach the camp. \"Thanks again,\" Caitlyn says. \"Do you know how this flood started?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17ComplicatedCaitlyn">\"It\'s a bit complicated,\" I tell her.</string>
    <string name="ch17YukioSurprised">\"Kaden, I have to be honest. I did not expect you to return, but you did. For that, I thank you,\" Yukio smiles earnestly.</string>
    <string name="ch17SarahKneels">I see Sarah kneeling on the ground. \"Sarah!\" I shout.</string>
    <string name="ch17IGoToSarah">I land on the ground, next to her. \"Alexander, is that you?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17TideApproachesSarah">\"Yeah, it is me,\" I smile. I look in the distance and see a tidal wave coming towards us.</string>
    <string name="ch17ISaveSarah">\"Sarah, I don\'t want to scare you,\" I tell her, extending my tentacles. Sarah gasps. \"I need you to hang on tight. I\'m bringing us to the evacuation camp.\" I hold onto Sarah with my tentacles and climb back up.</string>
    <string name="ch17SarahAsksAboutMe">I leap between rooftops to reach the camp. \"What\'s going on, Alexander? How are you doing this?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17ComplicatedSarah">\"It\'s a bit complicated,\" I tell her. \"Do you remember interviewing a police officer a few days ago?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17SarahAsksWhy">\"Yes, why?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17IAmPhantom">\"I was the person whom the officer encountered,\" I explain. \"I\'m called a \'phantom\' now, a being who has the ability to possess other people. That officer blacked out because I had been possessing him.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17LotToTakeIn">\"Oh, I see,\" Sarah sighed. \"That\'s a lot to take in, though.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17WeReachCamp">We finally reach the camp. There are at least a hundred thousand people here waiting to be evacuated.</string>
    <string name="ch17CaitlynPullsMe">While we wait among the crowd for rescue, Caitlyn pulls me aside.</string>
    <string name="ch17WhyDidCaitlynPullMe">\"I\'ve been wanting to talk to you about something,\" Caitlyn says.</string>
    <string name="ch17WhatIsItCaitlyn">\"Sure, what is it?\" I ask.</string>
    <string name="ch17CaitlynKnowsMeForYears">Caitlyn says, \"Well, we\'ve known each other for six years, and …\"</string>
    <string name="ch17IKnowCaitlynLeadsMe">\"Oh, I know where this is going,\" I chuckle.</string>
    <string name="ch17CaitlynWantsToBeClose">\"You do? Heheh,\" Caitlyn laughs awkwardly. \"You\'re a good guy, Kaden. I\'d … like to be closer to you.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17NoObjectionCaitlyn">\"No objection here,\" I smile.</string>
    <string name="ch17CaitlynStaresAtMe">\"Heh … that\'s good,\" Caitlyn nods. We look at each other.</string>
    <string name="ch17WeKiss">We kiss.</string>
    <string name="ch17IPullSarah">While we wait among the crowd for rescue, I pull Sarah aside.</string>
    <string name="ch17IExplainToSarah">I explain more to her. I tell her how I studied at university to become a scientist. I tell her how I became a phantom as part of a science project. I finally admit that I had possessed her.</string>
    <string name="ch17DidIPossessSarah">\"So … I don\'t remember anything from yesterday because you possessed me? Is that correct?\" Sarah asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17ThatIsCorrect">\"Yeah, that\'s correct,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch17WhyDidIPossessSarah">\"Why did you possess me?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch17IWantedSarahToUnderstand">\"Because … because I knew that you were going to interview someone else who saw me, and I didn\'t want you to misunderstand who I was or what I was doing.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17MyPowersAreNew">I sigh, \"I\'m sorry if I sound selfish. These powers are still new to me. I\'m still trying to make sense of them.\"</string>
    <string name="ch17SarahUnsure">\"I understand, Alex. I\'m not sure how to feel about this, myself. Give me some time to think.\" Sarah said.</string>
    <string name="ch17DidSarahAttendReunion">I nod. \"Oh, and Sarah, I\'ve been meaning to ask you this, but did you at least get to go to our high school reunion after I dispossessed you?\"</string>
    <string name="ch17YeahSarahDid">\"Yes, I did, actually,\" she replies.</string>
    <string name="ch17ThatIsGood">\"Well, that\'s good,\" I say, relieved.</string>
    <string name="ch17IAmNotBad">\"You also did a good job of dressing me up, actually. Maybe you\'re not such a bad guy, after all,\" she smiles.</string>
    <string name="ch17ThanksEmbarrassed">\"Oh, thanks,\" I say, embarrassed.</string>
    <string name="ch17SarahAndIWillRoom">\"Hey, Alex, I don\'t have anywhere to live in the mainland. Once we are evacuated, do you want to be roommates with me? We can split rent,\" she suggests.</string>
    <string name="ch17IdLoveTo">\"Sure, I\'d love to.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18Title">Chapter 18</string>
    <string name="ch18pTimeLater">19 years later …</string>
    <string name="ch18pStadium">Tonight, I am at New Ferando stadium to give a speech. I walk briskly through the tunnels and exit out onto the field.</string>
    <string name="ch18pIEnterStage">I walk onto the stage.</string>
    <string name="ch18pCountlessPhantoms">I look at the countless phantoms around me. It seems like the stadium\'s seats are nearly filled with them.</string>
    <string name="ch18pIGreetPhantoms">I pick up the microphone. \"Good evening, citizens of the western continent,\" I greet them.</string>
    <string name="ch18pGrownCommunity">\"Over 19 years, we have grown into a giant community. From the beginning, this land has been our home.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18pNextChapter">\"We are powerful entities, capable of controlling weaker beings,\" I continue. \"It is clear, then, that we phantoms are the next chapter in our world\'s history.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18pInfiltrateSociety">\"That is why I am pleased to announce that, over the course of the next several years, we will infiltrate the societies of the outside world.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18pYeah">\"Yeah!\" the audience shouts.</string>
    <string name="ch18pWeWillRule">I nod in glee. \"The people of the southern continent will be under phantom rule, as will the people of the southeastern continent, and the eastern continent, and the northern continent. And last, but far from least, the mainland itself will be ours.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18pApplause">The crowd applauds.</string>
    <string name="ch18csTimeLater">6 months later …</string>
    <string name="ch18cRaylenPark">Caitlyn and I are walking Foxtrot around Raylen Central Park, in the mainland. The day is clear and sunny.</string>
    <string name="ch18cFoxtrotStoppedHiss">While he had hissed at me earlier, Foxtrot has since gotten used to me having Bek\'Shtii\'s blood.</string>
    <string name="ch18cCaitlynWantsStrawberry">We come across a man with an ice cream cart. \"Ohh, let\'s get ice cream! I want strawberry,\" Caitlyn says.</string>
    <string name="ch18cIWantVanilla">\"Sure, uh … I\'ll get vanilla,\" I tell her.</string>
    <string name="ch18cWeBuyIceCream">We go up to the vendor and buy our ice cream. \"Right. Strawberry for the fine young lady, and vanilla for the gent. Here you go,\" the vendor says, handing our ice cream.</string>
    <string name="ch18cWeEat">\"Yum! Thanks for taking Foxy and me out,\" Caitlyn says, eating her ice cream. Foxtrot perks up at her.</string>
    <string name="ch18csWeGoToFlat">After our outing, we drive to our new flat.</string>
    <string name="ch18cWeCuddle">The afternoon passes. At night, I light our fireplace. Caitlyn and I cuddle on the couch in front of it.</string>
    <string name="ch18cIExaminePhoto">Caitlyn lays her head on me and closes her eyes. I reach into my pocket and take out an old photograph of Rebecca and me.</string>
    <string name="ch18cCaitlynSeesPhoto">Caitlyn opens her eyes. \"Who\'s that?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch18cFormerAngst">\"A former source of angst,\" I tell her.</string>
    <string name="ch18cWeLookedCute">\"How come?\" Caitlyn looks up at me. \"You two look cute together.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18cThingsDoNotWorkOut">\"Thanks. I thought so, too, but sometimes, things don\'t work out,\" I shrug.</string>
    <string name="ch18csIBurnPhoto">I toss the photograph into the fireplace, and I watch it burn.</string>
    <string name="ch18sSupermarket">Sarah and I are grocery shopping at a supermarket in Raylen, a suburban city in the mainland. Sarah finishes by buying some low-fat yoghurt for herself. \"Thanks for coming out with me,\" Sarah smiles.</string>
    <string name="ch18sWeBuyGroceries">We go to the checkout lane and pay for our groceries. \"I recognise you two from before,\" remarks the grocer. \"What have you been doing?\" he asks.</string>
    <string name="ch18sWeMightStay">\"Oh, I was a news reporter on the western continent, for KNFN News. I\'m looking for a new position in journalism here.\" Sarah glances at me and smiles. \"I think that we might stay here.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18sAlwaysAPleasure">\"Right then, always a pleasure to see westerners such as yourselves,\" smiles the grocer. \"Have a nice day.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18sWeCuddle">The afternoon passes. At night, I light our fireplace. Sarah and I cuddle on the couch in front of it.</string>
    <string name="ch18sSarahKnowsMeBetter">\"I\'m glad that I\'ve gotten to know you better,\" says Sarah.</string>
    <string name="ch18sSoAmI">\"So am I,\" I say.</string>
    <string name="ch18sWeKiss">We kiss.</string>
    <string name="ch18sIExaminePhoto">Sarah lays her head on me and closes her eyes. I reach into my pocket and take out an old photograph of Rebecca and me.</string>
    <string name="ch18sSarahSeesPhoto">Sarah opens her eyes. \"Is that you and Rebecca?\" she asks.</string>
    <string name="ch18sYeahItIs">\"Yeah, it is,\" I tell her.</string>
    <string name="ch18sWeLookedCute">Sarah looks up at me. \"I didn\'t realize how cute the two of you were together. I\'m sorry that things didn\'t work out.\"</string>
    <string name="ch18sINuzzleSarah">\"It\'s okay. You and I are together now,\" I say, nuzzling her.</string>
    <string name="ch18vTimeLater">1 year later …</string>
    <string name="ch18vGoddessOfPride">I am Va\'Nal-Kaden, the goddess of pride.</string>
    <string name="ch18vContinentIsWell">I look over the western continent, to make sure that all is well with its inhabitants.</string>
    <string name="ch18vCaitlynAndYukioResearch">Caitlyn Rylie and Yukio Kiyoshi, who originally evacuated to the mainland, have since returned to the Arcticon Research Facility. They continue to do research, as usual.</string>
    <string name="ch18vCaitlynAndYukioTogether">They also seem to be quite happy with each other.</string>
    <string name="ch18vSarahReports">Sarah Parson has also returned from her initial evacuation. She has earned much respect as a news reporter for KNFN. The public has since forgotten the \"Phantom of the West\", so Sarah now continuously looks for the next big story.</string>
    <string name="ch18vElodieCarleighAndHewittStudy">Élodie, Carleigh, and Hewitt are now in ninth grade. They\'re all doing well in school.</string>
    <string name="ch18vCarleighHonors">Carleigh is even an honors student now! She can thank me for that.</string>
    <string name="ch18vICannotSeeRebecca">I don\'t know how well Rebecca is doing. I presume that she\'s in the mainland. My powers are limited to this continent, so I can\'t watch over her if she\'s not here. It may as well be for the better, though.</string>
    <string name="ch18vSunSets">I stand by my brothers at the top of our pyramid. The sun sets behind us. Another day ends.</string>
    <string name="theEnd">The End</string>
